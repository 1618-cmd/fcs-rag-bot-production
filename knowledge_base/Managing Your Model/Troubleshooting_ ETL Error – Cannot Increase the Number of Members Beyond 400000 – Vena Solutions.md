Suggested solution #2
Redesign the data model to move the bulk dimension into the value dimension. This treats the
members as values to save space in the data model.
If assistance is required when doing so, reach out to your Customer Success Manager to connect
with the Professional Services team.
Cause
There is a limit of 400,000 members per data model. Attempting to load more members gives this
error.  Visit this article for more information on maximum members and member characters .
