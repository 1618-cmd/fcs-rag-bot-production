2. Selecting a Data Model
After opening your Ad Hoc file, select Build a New Report. You’ll then be prompted to select a
data model. Once you select your data model, select Apply.
Note
Each Ad Hoc query is limited to one data model. To select another data model, create
a new Excel sheet to trigger Ad Hoc.  05/01/2026, 15:04 How-To: Using Vena Ad Hoc To View Your Data and Make Simple Reports – Vena Solutions

3. Selecting Your Dimensions and Members
Once you select your data model, all dimensions populate in the Page section of the Vena Ad
Hoc task pane. To generate intersections:
1. Drag and drop at least one dimension to both the Row and Column sections.

2. Choose members by selecting the arrow next to the dimensions.
3. Select an individual member manually or use the context menu with parent operators.
4. Selecting multiple members in the Page section prompts the Ad Hoc tool to create a drop-
down menu within the Ad Hoc grid. This allows you to browse through the various members05/01/2026, 15:04 How-To: Using Vena Ad Hoc To View Your Data and Make Simple Reports – Vena Solutions

in that dimension, which automatically updates the data displayed in the grid.
4. Interacting With the Ad Hoc Grid
Once you’ve created your intersection, the Ad Hoc grid appears, which supports formatting. Any
formatting applied to your grid will remain unchanged upon Refresh. You can format the
following areas in the Ad Hoc grid:
1. Dimension Headers: These cells show which dimension is placed on the grid. The default
color is green with white text. When additional dimensions are added to the same section,
the header adopts the format of the uppermost and leftmost header.
2. Dimension Members: These cells display the members you selected. By default, the cells
have no fill and black text.
3. Intersection Values: These cells display the values that result from your query. By default,
the cells have no fill and black text.  05/01/2026, 15:04 How-To: Using Vena Ad Hoc To View Your Data and Make Simple Reports – Vena Solutions

Note
Vena Ad Hoc will remove formatting from dimensions, members and intersection
values when you perform structural changes to the Ad Hoc query. Structural changes
include:
Dragging a dimension from one section to another.
Adding or removing members in the grid.
While Refresh can restore deleted dimension headers, members and intersection
values, inserting or deleting rows or columns that affect the Ad Hoc grid may result in
undesired formatting behavior. It is recommended that users respect the Ad Hoc grid05/01/2026, 15:04 How-To: Using Vena Ad Hoc To View Your Data and Make Simple Reports – Vena Solutions

5. Saving, Sharing and Reusing Ad Hoc Files
Save Ad Hoc files on your local computer or in Cloud storage to resume work at any time without
needing to upload them to your Vena environment. You can reauthenticate within the Ad Hoc
file and continue where you left off.
and refrain from inserting or deleting cells. Identify the Ad Hoc grid’s location by
utilizing the named range in Excel.
Use Excel’s functions and formulas outside of the Ad Hoc grid to enhance your data
analysis.  05/01/2026, 15:04 How-To: Using Vena Ad Hoc To View Your Data and Make Simple Reports – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419294879757-How-To-Using-Vena-Ad-Hoc-To-View-Your-Data-and-Make-Simple-Reports 15/27

Ad Hoc files can be shared with colleagues through email, direct messaging or a shared drive. If
the recipient has Vena 365 installed and the appropriate access, Data and Application
Permissions, they can access the file.
Feature highlights
Drill Down
The Drill Down feature allows users to view a table containing all the bottom-level members
rolled up to the parent member in the Ad Hoc query. Since Drill Down provides insights into data
at deeper levels of the member hierarchy, it is only functional for intersections that are not
bottom-level.
Note
The Drill Down table has a limit of 100,000 rows. 05/01/2026, 15:04 How-To: Using Vena Ad Hoc To View Your Data and Make Simple Reports – Vena Solutions

Drill Saves
The Drill Saves feature allows users to view the history of an intersection point, showing a record
of all changes made to the value of that intersection. The user must have appropriateData
Permissions to view Drill Saves. Depending on the save type, users may also download the file
where the resulting save was made.
Note
Drill Saves can only be performed on bottom-level members.05/01/2026, 15:04 How-To: Using Vena Ad Hoc To View Your Data and Make Simple Reports – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419294879757-How-To-Using-Vena-Ad-Hoc-To-View-Your-Data-and-Make-Simple-Reports 17/27

Drill Transactions
The Drill Transactions feature allows users to view transactional data associated with an
intersection value. The transactional data resides in Vena tables that are maintained by the Vena
Admin.
Choose the Vena table that contains the transactional data related to the intersection value. If
any issues arise, reach out to your Vena Admin.
The Drill Saves functionality is not applicable to the Drill Down or Drill Transaction
tables created within those specific functions.

Aggregation
The Aggregation feature enables users to select multiple members within the same dimension
and retrieve the aggregated values independent of their hierarchical relationship. This feature
allows users to quickly summarize specific slices of data on demand. 05/01/2026, 15:04 How-To: Using Vena Ad Hoc To View Your Data and Make Simple Reports – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419294879757-How-To-Using-Vena-Ad-Hoc-To-View-Your-Data-and-Make-Simple-Reports 19/27

Aggregation is only available if the selected dimension is in the Page section. Enable by toggling
Aggregation Selection in Sheet to ON. You can select up to ten members for each dimension you
want to aggregate. 05/01/2026, 15:04 How-To: Using Vena Ad Hoc To View Your Data and Make Simple Reports – Vena Solutions

When Aggregation is enabled, all selected members are displayed on the grid in a comma-
separated list. Without Aggregation enabled, selecting multiple members activates the drop-
down list for quick data pivots.
Suppress Zeros
The Suppress Zeros feature in Vena Ad Hoc allows users to filter out rows without data, helping
users to focus on data that is relevant to their needs.
To enable Suppress Zeros for your Ad Hoc query:
1. Select your profile icon.
Note
There is a limit of 10 members allowed per dimension when enabling Aggregation.
Users can enable Aggregation for more than one dimension.
Drill Functions are not supported when Aggregation is enabled.05/01/2026, 15:04 How-To: Using Vena Ad Hoc To View Your Data and Make Simple Reports – Vena Solutions

2. Select Settings.
3. Under Sheet Preferences, toggle Suppress Zeros to ON:
When Suppress Zeros is enabled, suppression occurs automatically after a successful refresh.
The selection count in the Row section shows how many members you picked. After refreshing,
some rows may be hidden due to suppressed zeros, so the displayed count might differ from
your original selection.05/01/2026, 15:04 How-To: Using Vena Ad Hoc To View Your Data and Make Simple Reports – Vena Solutions

Sheet Preferences
Ad Hoc currently offers formatting preferences that can modify the presentation and display of
dimension members. To access these preferences:
1. Select your profile icon.
Note
Drill Functions work with Suppress Zeros enabled.
Aggregation mode works with Suppress Zeros; however, when enabled, it shares
the same limitations as Aggregation.
Note
This section was formerly called Formatting Preferences.05/01/2026, 15:04 How-To: Using Vena Ad Hoc To View Your Data and Make Simple Reports – Vena Solutions

2. Select Settings.
3. Enable or disable the available options to suit your needs.
Logging In From an Excel File05/01/2026, 15:04 How-To: Using Vena Ad Hoc To View Your Data and Make Simple Reports – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419294879757-How-To-Using-Vena-Ad-Hoc-To-View-Your-Data-and-Make-Simple-Reports 24/27

Vena Ad Hoc is accessible without needing to download a file from your tenant. Users can log in
to Ad Hoc directly from an Excel file, enabling further integration of Vena with any Excel file. To
log in to Vena Ad Hoc from an Excel file:
1. Open any Excel file.
2. Navigate to the Insert tab in the Excel ribbon.
3. Select Vena 365.
4. Log in to V ena Ad Hoc by entering your email address. Users will be routed to the authentication method set by
the V ena Admin.
Notes & Limitations

To use Vena Ad Hoc, you will need an updated version of Microsoft Excel. For optimal
performance, we recommend using Excel under a Microsoft 365 subscription. While Vena Ad
Hoc may work with older versions of Excel, we may not be able to resolve issues that arise
from earlier versions of Excel.
There is a maximum of 1 million intersections.
Navigating between tabs too quickly can compromise the structural integrity of an Ad Hoc
query, causing a broken query that cannot return intersection values. Ad Hoc displays a
loading spinner as a sign that the Ad Hoc query is still processing. Wait until the process is
complete before moving to another tab.
Vena Ad Hoc is not compatible with the Legacy Ad Hoc tool. Reports created in Legacy Ad Hoc
will not integrate with Vena Ad Hoc and must be recreated using the new Vena Ad Hoc tool. 05/01/2026, 15:04 How-To: Using Vena Ad Hoc To View Your Data and Make Simple Reports – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419294879757-How-To-Using-Vena-Ad-Hoc-To-View-Your-Data-and-Make-Simple-Reports 25/27

Manager users should not save Ad Hoc files back to a Vena tenant as this would create
undesirable and unsupported behavior. Save your Ad Hoc files onto your desktop or a shared
drive.
Vena Ad Hoc respects the Data Permissions established for your users. However, users must
be careful when sharing files with intersection values with individuals who do not have the
same Data Permissions. While data permissions are applied during refresh, the values
remain until another refresh or manual deletion occurs. Users should be mindful when
sharing sensitive information.
