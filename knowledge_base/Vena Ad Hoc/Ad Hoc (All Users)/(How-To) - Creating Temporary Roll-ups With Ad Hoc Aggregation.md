Product UpdatesRoll-ups are valuable, but require planning. Typically, a Modeler must create an alternate
hierarchy or calculated member, and a Manager must map it to the report. Since not every
scenario can be anticipated, gaps occur.
Ad Hoc Aggregation fills those gaps by letting users create custom, session-based roll-ups
directly in the report. It works by multi-selecting page options in the Choose menu, which
aggregates the selected members. These roll-ups are temporary and not saved to the database,
making it low-risk for template designers.
Where it works:
Available on any template with page options.
Designed for reports, not input templates.
Before you begin
To follow the instructions in this article, you will need Manager access.
To use Ad Hoc Aggregation on a Vena file, the file must have page options configured (i.e., the
Choose button must be active).
Note
Whenever Ad Hoc Aggregation is used on a template, the Save Data button is
disabled. Saving data is not possible until the user switches back to a single page
option selection.  05/01/2026, 15:06 How-To: Creating Temporary Roll-ups With Ad Hoc Aggregation – Vena Solutions

1. Open the template and select Choose in the Vena Desktop ribbon.
2. Open a drop-down to see the available options.

options are available and Ad Hoc Aggregation can't be used on the template.05/01/2026, 15:06 How-To: Creating Temporary Roll-ups With Ad Hoc Aggregation – Vena Solutions

Notes & limitations
Selecting both a parent and its children may double-count values.
Aggregation always sums members, regardless of their Modeler-defined operators.
Mult-choose doesn't work with dimensions mapped via Form Variable.
Roll-ups created this way are not usable as cell references.
