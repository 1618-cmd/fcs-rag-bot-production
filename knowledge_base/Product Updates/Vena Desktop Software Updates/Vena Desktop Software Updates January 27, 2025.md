Action Required: Update Vena Desktop. Not updating may result in the
inability to continue using Vena Desktop.
This release includes an update to Vena Desktop’s code signing certificate. The
current certificate will expire on January 27, 2025. As a result, the digital signature for
Vena Desktop will change. This change to the digital signature and the expired
certificate may cause security software to flag Vena Desktop as insecure. Accept the
Vena Desktop update promptly to ensure uninterrupted access and maintain
security.

How is this update an improvement over the previous installation?
The Vena Desktop Add-in and the Vena Desktop installer work hard to be aligned
with industry standards. This newest update ensures we meet the industry’s security
protocols.
Why are we just getting notice today?
In order to update the build process to deliver secure software in addition to
updating the code signing change, the process took longer than expected.
