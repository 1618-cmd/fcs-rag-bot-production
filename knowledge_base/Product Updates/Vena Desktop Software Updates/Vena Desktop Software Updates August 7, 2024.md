March 25, 2024Bug fixes
This fixed a bug where Contributors were encountering an unrecoverable error when
switching Choose options. Now, users won't receive an error when switching Choose options.
This fixed a bug where the formula VenaSetMemberDisplayStyle("Section","Block","alias") was
showing the Alias but not the corresponding data. Now, the formula displays the correct data
and Alias as expected.
This fixed a bug where block wildcard mappings were deleted during "hide all dynamics".

For optimal template performance, limit the hybrid file to 10 MB or less. Managers will now
