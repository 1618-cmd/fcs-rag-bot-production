New features and enhancements
The system now checks for 64-bit Excel during installation. Vena recommends using 64-bit
Excel and 64-bit Microsoft. If users do not have (or we cannot detect) 64-bit Excel, users can
still install Vena Desktop, but they will receive a warning.
An improvement has been made to how Attributes are loaded. It no longer unnecessarily
loads the member twice, which was previously causing performance issues for some users.
Bug fixes
Thisresolved a bug that was causing multi-dynamic rows to continue duplicating instead of
displaying the proper row. This bug was related to issues with form variables when
dimensions weredeletedand then re-added to the data model. This is now resolved, and
multi-dynamic rows load correctly.
