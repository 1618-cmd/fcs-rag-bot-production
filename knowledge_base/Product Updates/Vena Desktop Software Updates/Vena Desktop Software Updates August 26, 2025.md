March 25, 2024When using the Analyze tool, Managers will see an error if a dimension member name

member’s name or alias, since Vena treats names and aliases as a single set. For example:
Member NameAliasVena
Mar 03Mar(03)
Mar (03) Mar(03)
If a template has been inactive for the session expiration time set in Admin > Policies > Security
