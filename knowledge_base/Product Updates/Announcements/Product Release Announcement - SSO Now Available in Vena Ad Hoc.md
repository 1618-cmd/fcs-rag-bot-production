As part of this update, users will encounter a login modal where they can enter the email
address associated with their Vena account. This process routes users to their designated
authentication method, whether that’s password, Two-Factor Authentication or Single Sign-On.
While the core functionality of Vena Ad Hoc remains unchanged, the login experience has been
streamlined and modernized to improve usability and align with current best practices in secure
authentication.
