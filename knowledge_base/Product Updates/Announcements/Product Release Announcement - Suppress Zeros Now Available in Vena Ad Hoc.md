What’s New?
A new Suppress Zero feature is now generally available within Vena Ad Hoc. When enabled,
rows containing zero or null values are automatically excluded when the sheet refreshes,
allowing users to work only with populated, relevant data.
Reminder: Vena Ad Hoc is accessible to all Vena users including Managers, Contributors and
Viewers, giving everyone the ability to explore, analyze and interact with their data more freely.
Whether you're building quick insights on the fly or diving deeper into specific data points, Ad
Hoc empowers every user with flexible, self-serve analysis—no advanced modeling or technical
setup required.
