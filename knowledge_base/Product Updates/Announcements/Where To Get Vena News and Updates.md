Product Announcements & Release Notes
Whenever we have an announcement about our products to share, you can find it in the Product
Updates section of the Vena Help Center. It houses all articles related to updates and changes in
Vena, and is split into three categories:
Announcements: Articles highlighting specific features & enhancements, such as major
product releases.
Vena Cloud Release Notes: Release notes detailing changes to Vena Cloud, divided into
updates for the Vena Web App (published every other Monday) and the Vena Excel Add-In for
Windows (published with each Add-In release).
Vena OnSite Release Notes: Release notes describing updates to Vena OnSite server and
Excel Add-In software.06/01/2026, 14:08 Where To Get Vena News and Updates – Vena Solutions

While you can bookmark each of these categories if you like, the best way to keep up with Vena
product news and release notes is to use the Help Center's Follow function: just click on the
Follow button in the top right of any category, and you will be automatically notified by email
whenever a new article is published in that category.
Plus, keep in mind that the latest announcements and release notes can also always be found in
the Promoted Articles on the Help Centre home page:06/01/2026, 14:08 Where To Get Vena News and Updates – Vena Solutions
