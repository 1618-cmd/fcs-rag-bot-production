What's New in Vena: Fall '23Here at Vena, our goal is to ensure that you’re using the best software available to make
informed financial and planning decisions. Part of that commitment includes keeping you
updated on any changes that might occur with software that integrates with Vena.
Recently, NetSuite decided to introduce a change to how they export data through Saved
Searches. If you use the NetSuite direct connection to bring NetSuite data into Vena and this
change may impact you. Please read on for more information and instructions on how to
respond to this change.
What is the change?
The behavior of the Account record's Name and Localized Name saved search fields will change
in NetSuite 2021.1, targeted for the first quarter of 2021 (rolling release from February 2021 to
April 2021).
Currently, the Account record has both a Name field and a Display Name field. NetSuite displays
the following information in these fields if you set or clear the Use Account Numbers preference:

Account: Name or Account: Display Name fields in any of the Saved Searches that you use to
bring data over to Vena.
To do this, find your saved searches in NetSuite and press Edit:06/01/2026, 14:06 Change Management Guidelines: NetSuite Saved Searches Export Update – Vena Solutions

If you see either of these fields then you need to replace them with Account: Display Name and
Account: Localized Display Name.  You also MUST make sure:
They are put in the same spot
The custom label matches what was used before
To summarize:
If you see... ...change it to
Account: Name Account: Display Name
