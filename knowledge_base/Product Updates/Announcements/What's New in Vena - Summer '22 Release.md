Release overview
All of the other exciting features included with this release
Modeler - Link Dimensions: The formerly named Share Dimension feature is now named
Link Dimensions. The icon is also updated to reflect this change. Previously with Share
Dimensions, users needed to select a Member to extend the model on to complete the
sharing of a dimension - with Link dimensions, Vena automatically extends the model on the
‘Undefined’ member.
Modeler Improvements: Many improvements have been made to the Modeler experience
including the text cursor being enabled without needing to click on it when editing members,
a scroll bar and alphanumeric ordering in the attributes filter dropdown and the addition of
an Add Another button when creating members. Keyboard accessibility has also been
enhanced to allow for more functionality when editing members to Tab, Enter, Esc etc. for
easier and more efficient navigation.
Admin - User Passwords: The Password column in the Admin > Users table is now removed.
Moving forward, Admins can trigger a “Reset Password” action on behalf of a user. In these
instances, the user will reset the password themselves.
Admin - Changes to Enable/Disable SSO: Admin can now enable and disable Single Sign On
(SSO) without losing the SAML provider settings. However, when SSO is disabled, all users will
not be able to access Vena via SSO until it is re-enabled.
Vena 365 Connect - Insert MDR: Line Item Details (LIDs) are now supported with Insert MDR
in Vena 365 Connect.06/01/2026, 14:03 What's New in Vena: Summer '22 Release – Vena Solutions
