It's almost here: Vena's Spring '21 release! In this release, we feature a New Modeler
experience, improvements to Power BI Connector and more!
About the release
In this release, we've focused on helping you work with more agility and gain a better
understanding of your business drivers. The introduction of Member aliases to the Vena Power
BI Connector takes the guesswork out of your Power BI reports, while the formal release of the
New Modeler makes it easier to see and interact with your data. In addition, a relaunched
Versioning hub enables you to create and save Versioning configurations for future use. 06/01/2026, 14:06 What's New in Vena: Spring '21 Release – Vena Solutions

The introduction of aliases to the Power BI connector provides you with an import asset for data
visualization.  Aliases offer more "human-friendly" names for fields and give important context
when viewing graphs. You can now use your department name, account name cost center
and/or entity when creating, and viewing your Vena Power BI reports.
