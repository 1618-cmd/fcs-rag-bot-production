templates—tag your collaborators in comments or read and respond to comments other

you’ve been tagged in. This takes your planning process further by improving your ability to
collaborate directly in Vena.

New Modeler Member Page Improvements
New Modeler Member Page improvements are here to make your Modeler experience even
better. With these new changes, you can create members with fewer clicks, experience greater
keyboard accessibility, view share and default member icons more clearly, and work within a
revised table view that has optimized column spacing for nested members.

New Viewer Role
With the introduction of the new Viewer role, you can set up users with read-only access to
templates. Users with Viewer permissions can view templates, leave and respond to comments
and access audit trail, but do not have permission to change/input data. This maintains the
integrity of your data while seamlessly letting stakeholders access important information.
