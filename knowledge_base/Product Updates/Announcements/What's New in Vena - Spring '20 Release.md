It's Spring and Vena's second product release of 2020 is just around the corner! In our
most recent release, we're offering up Vena Flag support for LIDs (Line-Item Details),
Shared Dimension Support for Tenant Migration, and Calcs Performance
Enhancements.
About the release
In this release, we're focusing on further refining and improving functionality for Vena Flags in
the Vena Add-in. Tenant Migrations is now more comprehensive than ever with full support for
migrating data models with shared dimensions. We’ve also improved the Vena Calcs experience
with more transparent Lock Calc Targets and general Calc performance enhancements.
In this overview, you will find details about each of the features included with this release. All of
these features are now available on vena.io. 06/01/2026, 14:07 What's New in Vena: Spring '20 Release – Vena Solutions

Release overview
All of the other exciting features included with this release
Line Item Details (LIDs) support for #Lock Vena Flags: LIDs cells on Excel templates are
now locked/unlocked based on their own row’s #lock flags, rather than based on general-
template #lock flags. Click here for more details on Vena #Lock Flags.
Locked Calc Targets Improvements for ETL: We’re providing more detailed in-system
messaging when any ETL job attempts to write to lock calc targets. This includes an in-system
guardrail to help prevent users from overriding their data with calcs (and vice versa).
Calc Performance Enhancements: Continued efforts on the Calcs performance for Vena
Users means that Calcs will now run faster and more efficiently on Save and Deploy.
Drill Calc Highlight Functionality To aid in calc development and troubleshooting, the  Drill
Calcs window will now highlight the associated scope when users click on it.  Click hereto
read more about highlighted Drill Calcs.
