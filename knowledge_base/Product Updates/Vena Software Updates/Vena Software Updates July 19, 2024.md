Bug fixes
Manager: The option to enroll a template or report in Vena for Microsoft PowerPoint will

user selected Hierarchy or Hierarchy (BI) as an ETL Export. All dimensions wil not load and
users can selection dimenions and populate MQL queries as needed. 06/01/2026, 12:36 Vena Software Updates July 19, 2024 – Vena Solutions
