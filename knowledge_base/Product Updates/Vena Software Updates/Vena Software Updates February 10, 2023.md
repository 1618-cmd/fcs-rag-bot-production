June 06, 2025Modeler:This fixed a bug where member names that included a comma or quotation mark
were not appearing properly when a user previewed their data model. Instead of the
member appearing in Placeholder 1, the comma or quotation mark split the member name
into Placeholder 1 and 2. Now, users should see the member name appear correctly in the
data model preview.
