New features and enhancements
Manager: An Advanced Workbook setting has been added to Vena Desktop that allows Managers to add a button to
the Choose Box that allows users to perform manual searches for specific members. You can learn more about
Advanced Workbook settings in this article.
Modeler: Previously, users could see only the first 100 ETL jobs. This cap has been removed, and users can now see
all existing ETL jobs.

"Dashboards."

Bug fixes
Contributor: This fixed a bug where contributors were erroneously receiving two notification messages when a task
was rejected. This has been resolved, and users will receive only one notification.
Manager: This fixed a bug where process due date email notifications were not sent. All process due date email
notifications are being sent as expected.
Modeler: This fixed a bug in which Vena automatically generated a Currency column when users matched a
dimension pill and when a currency file was not uploaded.
Modeler: Fixed a bug that caused an error when users deleted a dimension with associated model slice permissions
and attempted to refresh the dataset or create a new dataset. This has been resolved, and the operation works as
expected.
