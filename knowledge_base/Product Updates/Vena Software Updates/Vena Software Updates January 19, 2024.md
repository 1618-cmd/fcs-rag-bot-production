Bug fixes
Vena 365: This resolved an issue that was preventing users from successfully downloading
files from emails. When users are mentioned in a comment on a V365 template, they receive
an email notification about the tag. However, when users selected the View File button in the
email, the template would not load successfully. Users can now open templates through
email.

June 06, 2025Modeler: This fixed a bug that was preventing ETL jobs writing to the Cube from completing
successfully in some instances. To resolve this, the system will now attempt three retries
before failing. With this fix, the number of errors when writing data to the Cube will be
reduced.
Modeler: This fixed a bug that was preventing users from sharing some members.
Previously, if a user added a range rule to a member and later switched the dimension type
from Account to anything else, they would be unable to successfully share any members that
had a range rule attached to it. Now, users can successfully share members with range rules
after changing the dimension type.
