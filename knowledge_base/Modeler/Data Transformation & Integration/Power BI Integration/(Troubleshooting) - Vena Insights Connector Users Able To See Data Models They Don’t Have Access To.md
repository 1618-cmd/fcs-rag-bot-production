Suggested solution
In some cases, an application token that does not have access to all data models is used but the
user is still able to see all data models in Vena Insights.
This is expected behavior. The user will see all data models but can only see data from data
models to which they have the necessary data permissions. If they try to access a data model
that they do not have access to, it will appear blank.05/01/2026, 12:43 Troubleshooting: Vena Insights Connector Users Able To See Data Models They Don’t Have Access To – Vena Solutions
