About the release
The introduction of member aliases to Power BI helps take the guesswork out of your Power BI
reports. Member aliases that you've created in your Vena data models can now be used to
display the department, account name, cost center, or entity you are analyzing when reviewing

How it impacts you
Will this change how my Vena Power BI Connector looks?
The introduction of aliases will duplicate the number of columns brought over to Power BI from
Vena. For example,  there is now an Account_alias column as well as the original Account
column. If a member does not have an alias set up in the corresponding Vena data model, then
only the member name will appear.
In the screenshot below, you can see the Account and Currency aliases (highlighted in green)
below each member:05/01/2026, 12:41 Explainer: Power BI Connector Member Aliases – Vena Solutions
