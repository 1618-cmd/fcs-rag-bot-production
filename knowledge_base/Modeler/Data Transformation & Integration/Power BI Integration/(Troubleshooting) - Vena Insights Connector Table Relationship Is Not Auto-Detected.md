Connector Table Relationship Is
Suggested solution
The relationship between all tables loaded into the Vena Insights Connector desktop application
is handled and auto-detected by Power BI. When a table or tables arenot auto-detected in the
relationship, you can manually create the relationship. See this external article from Power BI for
more details on how to create and manage relationships. 05/01/2026, 12:42 Troubleshooting: Vena Insights Connector Table Relationship Is Not Auto-Detected – Vena Solutions
