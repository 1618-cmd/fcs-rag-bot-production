Connector Table Relationship Is
Suggested solution
1. Check if intersections in Vena have text/string values. Notice that one intersection with a
numeric value in Vena was displayed correctly in Vena Insights.
2. If those intersections have text/string values then this is expected as the Vena Insights
Connector is only used for numeric intersection values in Vena. Any value that is not numeric
will be displayed as 0 in Power BI.
