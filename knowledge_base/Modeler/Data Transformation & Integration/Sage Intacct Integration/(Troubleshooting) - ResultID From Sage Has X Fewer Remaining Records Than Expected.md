ETL Error There Are Too Many
Operations Running for This
CompanyResultID X from Sage has X fewer records than expected. Please re-run the job.
Suggested solution
1. Check to see if an ETL job is running in Vena.
2. Check your Sage Intacct instance and ensure you are not making changes or manipulating
records while an ETL job runs.
3. Finish the changes if you are currently manipulating records or if data is changing in Sage
Intacct.
4. Once Sage Intacct changes are complete and the data is stable, return to Vena and re-run the
ETL job.
Cause
This may happen if your data in Sage changes while the ETL job is running concurrently.
