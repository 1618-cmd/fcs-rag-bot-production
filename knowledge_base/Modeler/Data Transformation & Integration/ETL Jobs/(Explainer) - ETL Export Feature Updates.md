Restrictions to the SQL WHEREWelcome to the new ETL Export experience! Based on customer feedback, we've made it easier
than ever to use our ETL Export, and we're excited to show you the feature updates. We've
redesigned the ETL Export experience to improve efficiency and create order while making it
easier than ever to export your data.

What's changing?
While the process for creating an ETL Export will not change, the user interface (UI) you see on
your screen will look slightly different.
Moving Export to its page and positioning it prominently in the navigation pane makes it
easier to locate and use.
 On the main page, you can select the data to export (Values, Hierarchy, etc.) and then refine
the export by writing a custom export query.
Easily export data from Vena Tables to export drill transaction or staging data.02/01/2026, 16:45 Explainer: ETL Export Feature Updates – Vena Solutions
