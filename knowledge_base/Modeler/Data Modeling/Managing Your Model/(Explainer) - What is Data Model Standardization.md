Product UpdatesWhy should I adopt Data Model Standardization?
With DMS, any data model can use Dimension Types and Standard Members, which are a Vena-
standard definition of dimensions and members. This Vena-standard dimension allows Vena to
understand any dimension or member, regardless of what you name it within your environment.
Dimension Types and Standard Members give context to what a dimension or member is used
for and allow Vena to understand data models better to build smarter features for you.

How do I add standard components to my existing data
model(s)?
Assigning Dimension Types and Standard Members to dimensions in your existing data models
allows you to apply standardization practices to any model. By assigning Dimension Types and
Standard Members, you can leverage product features that rely on them, such as FX Functions,
Vena Insights, and more. Find out how to assign Dimension Types and Standard Members.

What happened to Standard Models?02/01/2026, 14:13 Explainer: What is Data Model Standardization? – Vena Solutions

As of Fall 2023, Vena is moving away from Standard and non-standard models. Instead, with
Data Model Standarization, now any model can adopt standard practices with Dimension Types
and Standard Members. Data models that were formerly called “Standard Models” will no longer
have the Standard Model label. However, you can continue using them like any other data
model.
