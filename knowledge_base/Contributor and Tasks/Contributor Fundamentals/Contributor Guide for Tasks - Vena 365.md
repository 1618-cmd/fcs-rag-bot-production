Ready to begin? Then let’s get started with a quick intro to Vena.


Module 1: A Vena Primer  ⧫ ⬤ ■ Overview
What is Vena? How do I use it? This short primer answers some of the basic questions you might have
about Vena.
This is an informational module: it describes and explains how Vena works.


Reading Time
This module will take about 5 minutes to read ( 4 pages ).

Topics
This module covers the following topics:
• What Vena does, and how it works
• What a “Contributor” is
• How you use Vena as a Contributor

What does Vena do?

Maybe this sounds familiar: your planning process revolves around spreadsheets, and it routinely
grinds to a halt when nobody on the team can figure out which version of the spreadsheet is the most
recent one. Sometimes, there are even several totally diff erent spreadsheets floating around.


9

We call this situation spreadsheet hell , and it’s all
too common in many organizations. That’s why
Vena provides a solution to eliminate this
frustrating phenomenon, making
spreadsheetdriven business processes easier,
faster, and just all -around more pleasant  for
everyone involved.

How does Vena work?
For most people, the term “spreadsheet” immediately brings one thing to mind: Excel1.
Excel is everywhere. That’s great – everyone knows how to use Excel. But because it’s so popular, we use it
for all kinds of complex processes for which it wasn’t really designed. And since Excel can’t do important
things like version control or process management, this can often lead
to chaos and confusion.
The thing is, we know that you don’t want to learn how to use some
other tool: despite its limitations, you’d rather keep using Excel,
because you’re already familiar with it. We felt the same way, and
that’s why Vena’s approach is to embrace Excel – not replace it.
Rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, Vena enhances Excel by
adding the things it lacks: a central database, version control,
workflow integration, and a whole suite of useful features for
analysis and collaboration.
Where do I come in?

You will be using Vena as a Contributor . This is one of the handful of different user roles in Vena,
each of which revolves around a specific set of activities (some others you will see mentioned are
Manager , Modeler and Admin ).

1 Microsoft, Excel, Word, and PowerPoint are either registered trademarks or trademarks of Microsoft Corporation in the United States and/or other countries.





10


As a Contributor , you will use Vena to work on one or more of the following types of tasks:
• Input Tasks : Doing data entry on spreadsheets (such as budgets or forecasts)
• Review Tasks : Checking data inputs made by other users and approving/rejecting inputs
• Report Tasks : Consuming financial or other types of reports created using Vena data
When you’re assigned to a task, you are also given one of three levels of responsibility: the Owner is
responsible for the task’s completion and signing off on it; a Support Worker helps an Owner to
complete a task; and a Watcher is a stakeholder who monitors a task but is not directly involved with
working on it.


Because Vena builds on Excel, using it should feel familiar : with Vena, you’ll still use Excel
spreadsheets to do things like enter your budget numbers, just as you have always done.


With  Vena, those spreadsheets are now connected to an online database. That means that
any data you enter in a Vena spreadsheet is saved to the database, not in the Excel file
itself. Whenever you open a Vena spreadsheet, it will automatically pull the latest data for
that spreadsheet directly from the database. This ensures that everyone automatically has
the latest version of that spreadsheet, every time.




Vena also distributes the spreadsheets you need to
complete your tasks; no more digging through
email chains to find them.

Instead, a web -based interface will show you only
those files that are relevant to you, in a clear
tasklist  format. Just open any task to download its associated spreadsheets, along with instructions on
what you need to do.
It’s not just spreadsheets
You’re  most likely to use Excel spreadsheets with Vena,
but other types of files, including Word documents and
even PowerPoint presentations, can be used with Vena
too.
If you’re responsible for reviewing work others have done, you’ll also do that directly in Vena. Your
workflows are built right into the interface, so if you’re looking over the numbers and notice an error, you
can just kick the spreadsheet straight back to the person responsible with a single select.



11

How do I use Vena?
Let’s start with a high -level look at how you’ll use Vena in practice. Vena consists of two main parts: a web app
and an Excel task pane .


The Vena web app
The Vena web app  is where your business processes are tracked and managed. Think of it as a hub
where you can see the Vena tasks you need to work on.
These tasks are presented as a To Do list and selecting any task allows you to see details about it
(including instructions, comments left on the task by other users, etc.).

Each task contains task forms . These are the files you’ll use to complete the task. When talking about task
forms, we also sometimes use the more specific terms input template , which is a spreadsheet that
accepts data inputs, and report , which is a read -only spreadsheet that displays data, but can’t be used to
change that data.



12

Because you will often be using the same spreadsheets as other users when you input data, it’s
important to avoid data conflicts. That’s why when you’re inputting data in a task form, the file will be  In
Use.

When you’re inputting data in a  task form, the file is In Use  and only you can use it. When you
are no longer using the file, you can Return File  to make it available to others again.

Finally, when you have finished a
task, you complete it by submitting
it.
Submitting a task creates a
corresponding review task (for
another Contributor to check your
work); you may also perform
reviews. Just as with input tasks,
this involves downloading task
forms to review the data on them.
Depending on how the review
goes, y ou can then choose to
accept or reject the task right in the Vena web app.


13


Vena 365 in Excel
When you download a spreadsheet from Vena, it’ll open in
Excel — just like you’d expect. But unlike normal spreadsheets,
the ones you download from Vena are connected to your Vena
database.
To make this happen, we use a connector, which is an app that
plugs into Excel to extend its functionality. In Vena’s case, it ’s
the task pane to the right of the worksheet. This is
automatically displayed whenever you open a Vena file.

The main purpose of Vena 365 (V365) is to turn Excel into
powerful database software while still looking and working like
Excel. This makes learning how to use Vena easy, because you
can build on the Excel expertise that you already have.
We’ll show you how to use all the important features of Vena
365 in a later module. For now, here’s a brief rundown of some
of the things it allows you to do in Excel:
• Write data inputs to the database: Enter data into
designated input fields on a Vena -enabled spreadsheet,
then save it back to the database with one select.
• Refresh data: At any time, get the most up -to-date data
from your database on the spreadsheet you’re
currently using.
• Switch between different datasets : View related datasets (like prior year actuals vs. this
year’s budget) without having to open another spreadsheet. Plus, view different datasets side -
by-side for comparison.
• Add more detail to line items : Need to give a detailed breakdown of a budget figure? Break it
down to provide more granular information.
• Additional features:  Leave comments for other users, see a history of changes on a file, drill
into historical and transactional data, and upload/download files to and from your database.






14

What’s next?
Now that you know what Vena is and how it works, let’s get started! Over the next few modules, we’ll
make sure you have everything you need, then look at how to use the Vena web app and Vena 365 in
Excel.





What to do if you need help

We’ve done our best to include
everything you need to know as a
Contributor in this guide. But even so, it’s
always possible that you might run into something we didn’t cover.

If you get stuck at any point and can’t find the answer in this guide, don’t worry! Your best resource for

help is
usually your organization’s
Vena Power Users
(
who probably gave you this guide).

Get in touch with them, and they should be able to help you out of most jams.

• Path III: Reviewer  ■

Managing Your Tasks
In the Tasks Interface, everything revolves around your Task List. By default, it shows all your active tasks,
along with some further information about the task such as when it’s due. It will look something like this:






23












How to read and manage the Task List:

Task Categories
Your tasks are divided into Task Categories based on urgency. You can filter the task category by selecting it.

• To Do: Current tasks that are ready for you to work on, and whose due date is still in the future.

• Upcoming: Tasks that are upcoming, but not yet ready  because they haven’t been reached in
your process yet.

• View Only: Tasks (often reports) that don’t require any action on your part  and are available to
view at any time.

• Overdue:  Tasks that have a due date that is passed due.

Task Types
Next to each task, you’ll see an icon indicating what type of task it is:
• Input: Enter data on a spreadsheet.
• Review: Check inputs made by other Contributors for accuracy.
• Report: View financial and other types of reports.





24

Sorting the Task List
You can choose to sort the  task list by any of the columns in ascending or
descending order. To do that, just select the  arrows next to each column
header.

Viewing a Task
To view any task, just select it . The Task Details will open to display the task’s details:


You can switch between tasks by selecting a different one.




Filtering & Searching Your Task List
Making your Task List work for you is key, and there are a few ways you can find things more quickly, including
customizing which tasks appear in the list.


Why

does my Task List look different?

The
columns
you see in your Task List
might not be the same

as the ones shown in these screenshots.
That’s because your Vena Manager has the option to
customize them
. You can too! Find out how in
Appendix A
at the end of this guide.



25

Filtering by Task Type
Want  to only see tasks of a specific type, and
nothing else? Use the Task Type Filter in the
task pane on the left.
Just select the type of task you want to see,
and all tasks that aren’t of the selected type
will be hidden. To see all types of tasks again,
select the All option.





 Process Filtering
For more granular filtering of processes, use the Process
Filter . These allow you to customize your Task List based on
process status and process name.






26

Searching
To search for tasks matching one or more keywords, just start typing into the search box . The search
function will return the following:
• Tasks  that have been assigned to you, like Corporate Budget Review
• Processes that your tasks are part of, like Annual Budgeting
• Activities which are sub -sections of processes, like Department Budget Input

Module 5: Working on Vena Tasks  ⧫ ⬤ ■

Overview
Learn how to download files from Vena to work on your tasks, such as viewing reports, doing data entry,
or performing reviews.
This is an instructional module : it contains a guide on how to perform a task or action  in Vena.

Reading Time
This module will take about 5 minutes to read ( 3 pages ).

Topics
This module covers the following topics:
 Opening and viewing a task and its details
 Using and returning task forms
Downloading  task forms

Choose Your Path
This module is recommended for:

• Path I: Report Consumer ⧫
• Path II: Data Entry ⬤
• Path III: Reviewer ■

Opening a Task
In Vena, the files you use to work on your tasks are called task forms . To access the files you need, the
first step is to open the task it’s attached to. Here, you’ll also find more information about the task  itself.






28

How to open a task:



A. To get started on a task, select the task to open the Task Drawer .
B. Selecting the task opens up the task details. This section is divided into three tabs:
a Instructions & Documents
b Participants
c Comments
C. If the task has any additional reference material, you can usually find it in the Instructions &
Documents  tab. You can also check out the Comments , where you can discuss the task with
other Contributors assigned to it.
D. Now, go to the Template Name  section . It lists the files (task forms) that you’ll use to complete
this task.





29

Downloading Task Forms
To work on a task, you will need to download  and open its task forms in Excel .
• Any task form that can be used for data entry must not already be in use before you can
download it. When you begin inputting data in a task form that means that only you can work
on it  (unless your Manager has enabled the Concurrent Contributor option – see Appendix C in
this guide) which prevents conflicting inputs . When you select Input Data for a task form, it will
start downloading automatically .
• Task forms that can’t be used for data entry are view -only . This means that you can just
download (or “view”) them directly. Reports are always view -only.

How to download a task form:
1. In the Task Name section  of the Task Drawer, choose the task form you want to work on.
2. Select  Input  to start your download:




3. The task form will now automatically begin to download.



30

4. Once the download is finished (which should only take a few seconds), select the downloaded
file to open the task form in Excel.

Tip: You can set up your Excel files to open automatically by selecting the arrow  (highlighted in
the screenshot, below) and select “always open files of this type.”




5. Excel will open, and you should also see a Vena loading bar. Once everything has finished loading,
the contents of the task form will be displayed, and the Vena 365 pane will be visible  to the right
of the worksheet.

6. Your task form is now in use and open in Excel, so you can begin working on it. To do that, you’ll
use Vena 365 in Excel .





31




What does “Trust this

” mean?

The first time you open a file, you may see a message asking you to Trust this

or supporting documents that your manager has included to help you complete
your task.

F. Data Input Tools: These allow you to interact with data on a more personal
level.
• Use Add Line Item Detail and Remove Line Item Detail to add/remove additional
lines to a spreadsheet to provide context, additional formulas, etc.
• Use Insert Row  to enter missing intersection data.







34


G. Data Inspection:
• Expand: Expand to view a selected member’s children.
• Expand All: Expand All to view all descendants down to the bottom -level member.
• Collapse: Collapse to hide previously expanded descendants.
• Collapse All: Collapse All to hide all expanded descendants.

I. Resume Later: This allows you to stop at a certain point and exit the file. If you
select Resume Later , you’ll be asked if you would like to save data to Vena
before exiting the file.

If you select Save , the data in the spreadsheet will be saved back to the Vena database. If you
select Don’t Save , the file will close, and no data will be saved back to the Vena database.


J. Finish Input: This enables you to save your data back to the Vena database and
submit your task. When you select the Finish Input button, you will see a screen
that will ask you if you have completed all the files associated with your task and
inform you that once you have submitted the task, you will not be able to make
further changes to the files.

news is that the experience is almost the same as using a normal spreadsheet. All the normal Excel
functionality that you’re used to is there and works just as you expect.
Of course, a Vena spreadsheet opens with the Vena 365 menu active, and this offers additional
functionality that’s not available on a traditional spreadsheet.



37

Essential Vena 365 Functions
For all types of Vena users, the two most important functions in the Vena 365 menu are Choose and
Refresh . With these functions, you can:
• Switch between different datasets on the same spreadsheet ( Choose )
• Get the latest available data  (Refresh)

Using Choose
There are all kinds of situations where you might want to see a version of the same spreadsheet with
different numbers . For example, you might want to view the same report, but with last year’s figures for
comparison.
In Vena, a single spreadsheet can be configured to display multiple sets of data, which we refer to as
page options . On spreadsheets where page options are available, the Choose  function allows you to
select between them.
In fact, the  Choose  menu is the first thing you’ll see when you download any spreadsheet that has page options:


All you must do is use the dropdown menu(s) to choose the page option(s)  you want to view, then select
Apply Selection . There will be a separate dropdown menu for each dimension (or “category” of data)
you can choose from.
Want to switch to a different set of page options  later? Just select the Choose option  in Vena 365 at any
time to open the page options menu again:







38

Why is the Choose button not working?
The Choose button in the Vena menu will only be active if the designer of the
spreadsheet has set up different page options for you to choose from.
If you can only view one dataset on the spreadsheet you’re currently using, the  Choose
button will be disabled (greyed out).



Using Refresh
To make sure you’re looking at the most recent data,
just select the Refresh Data button in the Vena menu
ribbon at any time.
Vena will check with your database to see if there have
been any changes and will update the spreadsheet  accordingly.


Other Important Vena 365 Functions
In addition to the essential functions we’ve looked at, you can get even more from your Vena spreadsheets
by using the optional Audit Trail , Drill , and MDR Insert Row functions. With these functions, you can:
• Extract related, contextual data that is not visible on the spreadsheet from your Vena database ( Drill ).
• Add rows  to a dynamically mapped template ( MDR Insert Row ).
• Access a list of structural and data changes made in your template ( Audit Trail ).
For comprehensive information about each of these features, including what they do and how to use them,
please refer to their articles on our Knowledge Base at https://venasupport.zendesk.com/hc/en -us/:

Module 8: Entering Data  ⬤

Overview
If you’ve been assigned a task that requires you to input data, learn how to do data entry  on Vena spreadsheets.
This is an instructional module : it contains a guide on how to perform a task or action  in Vena.

Reading Time
This module will take about 4 minutes to read (2 pages ).

Topics
This module covers the following topics:
• Using a Vena spreadsheet for data inputs
• Saving your inputs to the Vena database

Choose Your Path
This module is recommended for:
• Path II: Data Entry ⬤

Making & Saving Data Inputs
Using a Vena task form to do data entry is easy: after you select Input Data open it in Excel , you simply
type your numbers into the appropriate cells, then save the data —just like on a normal spreadsheet.
(When they are used for data entry, we also use the term input template  to describe these task forms.)
However, there is a small but important difference between
Vena spreadsheets and normal Excel ones: on a Vena input
template, the Excel Save button won’t save your data
inputs !
Remember: in Vena, your spreadsheets are connected to a
database. When you save data on a Vena spreadsheet, you’re saving
that data directly to the database. To do this, you’ll need to use
Vena’s  Save Data  function, which is built into Vena 365.



40


How to make and save data inputs on a Vena spreadsheet:
1. With the spreadsheet open in Excel, find the cells where you are supposed to make inputs. The
designer of the spreadsheet will often highlight them in some way. In the screenshot below, for
example, the input cells are highlighted in blue :


2. Now, just type your data inputs into these cells, just like you would on any other Excel
spreadsheet.

3. When you’re finished (or any time you want to save your progress), select the Save Data to Vena
button  to save your inputs to the Vena database:

Closing a Vena Task Form
Once you’re finished making inputs and have saved
your work, you have two options: Resume Later  or
Finish Input .
Resume Later  enables you to:
• Stop at a certain point and exit the file. When you select the
Resume Later  button, you’ll be asked if you would like to save
data to Vena before existing the file.
• If you select Save , the data in the spreadsheet will save back to
the Vena database. If you select Don’t Save , the file will close,
and no data will save back to the Vena database.

Finish Input enables you to:
• Save your data back to the Vena database
• Submit your task (covered in more detail in Module 9)

When you select the Finish Input  button, you will see a screen that will ask you if you have
completed all the files associated with your task and inform you that once you have submitted the
task you cannot make further changes to the files.

Module 9: Submitting Completed Tasks  ⬤

Overview
Return to the Vena web app and learn how to submit completed tasks for review (if you have not already
submitted your task: see Finish Input on the previous page.)
This is an instructional module : it contains a guide on how to perform a task or action in Vena.

Reading Time
This module will take about 3 minutes to read (3 pages ).

Topics
This module covers the following topics:
• Submitting a data entry task for review
• Resubmitting rejected tasks

Choose Your Path
This module is recommended for:
• Path II: Data Entry ⬤

Submitting a Task
When you have completed all your assigned task forms and entered and saved the required data, there’s
just one more step to completing the task: submitting it (if you have not already submitted the task in
Vena 365 via the Finish Input button.)

 In most cases, submitting the task means submitting it for review, where another user checks your work
as part of your process workflow. And since your process is built into Vena, you submit your tasks right
from the Vena web app.



44


How to submit a task:
(If you have already submitted  the task in Vena 365, please move to the next section, Rejected Tasks .)

1. Return to the Vena web app (at vena.io) and view your Task List. Find the task you have just
completed and want to submit. Select it to expand it.

2. Select the  Submit  button. A confirmation window will appear. Select  Yes to proceed with
submitting the task.






3. That’s it! Your task is now submitted for review. The Status on the task will change to Under
Review , and the task will move in your Task List from the To Do section to the View Only  section.


Who can submit a task?

It’s common for multiple people to work on a single task.
So, who submits it?

First, only
Task Owners
are responsible for submitting tasks. If you have been assigned to a task as a
Support Worker or Watcher
, you don’t need to worry about submitting it.

If you’re one of multiple Task Owners on the task,
you or any other Task Owner can submit
the task, it’s

a good idea for everyone to coordinate before submitting.



45

Rejected Tasks
Well done, you’ve completed a task! Your work will now be reviewed .
But you might not be done quite yet: the person reviewing your task might reject it, for example if they
find an error. If this happens, you’ll need to return to the task to correct the issue and resubmit it.

How to resubmit a rejected input task:
1. A rejected submission gets added back to the To Do section of your Task List, where it is listed
with the status Rejected :



2. Select the task  to open the Task Details . Here, select Comments  to see the reason why it was
rejected .


3. Select the Forms  tab to work on the appropriate task forms  to resolve the issue.

4. When you’re done, you have two options:
•  You can submit the task by selecting the Finish Input  button in the open Excel spreadsheet; or  •
 You can use the Submit button in vena.io.

   If you submit via vena.io, select the Submit  button  in the Task Drawer again to resubmit the task.

When a task has been approved , you’ll see that its status in the Task List changes from Under Review  to
Approved, and be listed as Approved .

Module 10: Reviewing Data  ■
Overview
Learn how to review data inputs  made by other users.
This is an instructional module : it contains a guide on how to perform a task or action in Vena.

Reading Time
This module will take about 3 minutes to read (3 pages ).

Topics
This module covers the following topics:
• Reviewing a data entry task
• Approving or rejecting tasks

Choose Your Path
This module is recommended for:
• Path III: Reviewer ■

Reviewing Data Inputs
If you have been assigned a review task , you will review data entry work done by other users, checking
for errors and compliance with applicable rules. To do this, you will use the same spreadsheets that
were used to make the data inputs, as you would when reviewing a normal spreadsheet. Of cou rse, with
Vena, you are guaranteed to always be looking at the latest version automatically.

How to perform a review in Vena:
1. With the spreadsheet open in Excel, review it according to your organization’s gui delines and
instructions.



47


2. If you encounter any errors, you may be able to make corrections yourself  if the task form is set
up to allow this.
Here’s how to check:
• If you selected Input Data to download the task form, you:
• Can make changes yourself.
• If this is the case, see Module 8: Entering Data for instructions.

• If you selected View to download the task form, you:
• Will not be able to make changes yourself.
• Instead, use the Reject function to send the task back to the submitter to make
the necessary changes.

3. Once you have finished your review, select the Finish Review  button.



4. If you were working on a spreadsheet  you may be asked if you want to return the task form back
in (select Yes).


48



5. Download and review the next task form from the Vena web app. Repeat this process until you
have reviewed all the task forms  attached to the task.


49

Approving and Rejecting Reviews
If you identified that changes are needed during your review, and you were unable to make these
changes yourself, you can reject the task  back to the original submitter.

If everything was fine, you can approve the task , which will complete it and advance your Vena
workflow.
You can approve or reject a task at any time. Keep in mind that this will approve or reject the entire
task – you can’t reject only specific task forms .

How to approve or reject a review:
1. Return to the Vena web app (at vena.io) and find the review task you just worked on. Select it to
expand it .

2. In the bottom right, find the Approve and Reject  buttons:
3. If you need to reject the review, select the Reject  button. This will reassign the task back to the
user(s) who submitted it so that they can make the necessary changes.
4. When you select the Reject button, you will see a confirmation pop -up, along with a text box
where you can provide details for the rejection. Select Yes, Reject Task to proceed:
•  Entering a rejection reason may be optional or mandatory, depending on your Vena
settings. Even if it is optional, it is best practice to provide a reason.


5. The rejected task will be moved in your Task List from the To Do  section to the Upcoming
section, with the status Rejected .




50

6. If the review did not turn up any issues, you can simply approve it by selecting the Approve
button. As with rejecting a task, selecting Approve will bring up a confirmation pop -up. Select
Yes, Approve Task  to proceed.

7. Once a review on a task has been approved, it is considered completed. Completed tasks
are added to the View Only  section  of the Task List and marked with the status  Finished.






51

Appendix A : Additional Web App Features
This appendix describes additional functionality in the Vena web app  which was not covered in any of the earlier
modules.
These features are optional  and are recommended for users who want to take advantage of all available
functionality.

Customizing Task List Columns
In Module 4 , we mentioned that the appearance of your Task List might be different from the
screenshots in this guide. This is because the columns shown in the Task List can be modified . Here’s
how to do that:
1. On the Task page, use the Columns drop -down to customize the menu.



2. This menu displays all the available columns. To customize your
columns, select  any columns you want to make visible in the Task
List. Columns selected to be displayed will have a checkmark beside
them.
3. Select any currently visible column to remove it from your Task List.
This will remove the green highlight and checkmark.
4. When you select (add) or unselect (remove) a column, the change is
reflected in the Task List instantly and  is also saved automatically.
a Note that these changes only apply to your own Task List, not
those of other users.
5. Select anywhere within the Task List to close the menu.

Appendix B:  Additional Vena 365 Excel Features

This appendix describes additional functionality in Vena 365 for Excel  which was not covered in detail in
any of the earlier modules.
These features are optional  and are recommended for users who want to take advantage of all available
functionality, or whose Vena tasks require the use of these features.


Line Item Details
In Module 8, we mentioned that, for some input tasks , you might be asked to use the  Line item Details
feature. This feature is used whenever more granular detail on a data input is required.

For example, you might need to break down a
generic item like “Travel Expense” into separate line
items like “Flight”, “Lodging”, “Car Rental”, etc.
With Line item Details , you can enter these
individual line items onto the spreadsheet, and they
are automatically summed to the main item.

Line Item Details  (or LIDs  for short) lives in its own
section of the Vena 365 task pane, which we briefly
looked at in the overview in Module 6 . If LIDs have been
enabled on the task form (input template) that you’re
using, the  functions in this section will allow you to add
and remove LIDs, as well as move them around  on the
spreadsheet, if needed.


Since the Line Item Details feature must be specifically enabled on an input task form to be used, the
designer of the task form will usually note in the task instructions (or sometimes on a cover sheet in
the task form itself) if you should use LIDs  when making inputs.
To learn how to use  Line Item Details on your input tasks, please see this article in the Vena
Knowledge Base:
• How-To: Use Line Item Details as a Contributor in V365



54


Comments

In Module 8, we mentioned that you can use the Comments
feature to comment on data intersections at the cell level and
mention (@) specific users, all without leaving Excel.

1. With the spreadsheet open in Excel, select the Comments button in
the green ribbon.

2. There are two main views, Comments Summary and Comments
Details. By default, the task pane opens to the Comments Summary
view, which shows an overview of all intersections on the template
that contain comments, along with a preview of the most recent
comment for each one.

3. The Comments Summary  view provides cell references pointing to
where the commented intersections can be found on the current
template:




4. After opening the Comments task pane, you can review the  Comments Summary  pane to see
which cells have comments. You can also look at the template itself to see which cells contain a
flag. Cells with a flag contain comments.





55

5. Select a flagged cell  to view the linked comment chain.  Selecting a cell will cause the
corresponding comment chain to be highlighted in the Comments task pane (and vice -versa).




6. To access the Comments Detail view, select the  Reply icon on any comment to view the
comment in full and add a reply.  The comments are timestamped and sorted by date added:


7. To add comments, select the Add a New Comment  button in the Comments Summary  view to
add a new comment .



56




8. When you use the @ keyboard key to directly mention a user, once you add the comment, that
user will receive an email notification to let them know they’ve been mentioned in a comment. As
a Contributor,  you can only @ (mention) users that are assigned to the task  associated with
the template.



57

Appendix C:  Concurrent Contributor
This appendix describes the Concurrent Contributor option that is available in Vena.
These features are optional  and are recommended for users who want to take advantage of all
available functionality, or whose Vena tasks require the use of these features.


What is Concurrent Contributor

In Vena, inputting data in a task form as a Contributor means that you are "reserving" it: if a task
form is being used by you, no one else can work on it. Because only one person can use a task
form at any given time, this helps to prevent conflicting inputs and version control issues.
However, it also means that other Contributors who need to use the same form must wait until it
is available again.
Concurrent Contributor is an optional feature that Vena Managers can enable on task forms.
Instead of the entire task form being In Use as normal, Concurrent Contributor allows you to
use only a specific set of page options .

This means that multiple users can work on a task form at the same time : when one set of page
options is being used, this still leaves the remaining page options available for other users. For
task forms with many users, this can save a lot of time - you don't need to wait your turn to use
the file, because you can just work on it at the same time as everyone else.

How to

The process for using a Concurrent Contributor task form will work slightly differently depending on the
Template Property  that was set on it by your Vena Manager, as well as whether or not you are using
Windows.
Use the appearance of the In Use  button in the Contributor Task Accordion to determine which
instructions to use:
Input Data button looks like:  Template Property used  Use these instructions
  Central/Standalone  Method One
  Hybrid  Method Two


58




Method One: Central & Standalone Instructions for
using Concurrent Contributor task form

Use these instructions if you know that the template you are using is a Central or Standalone
template, or if the Input Data  button on the task form is split into two parts like this:

To use a Concurrent Contributor task form (Central/Standalone templates):
1. Log in to Vena. If you are not taken there by default, select Tasks or Contributor  to go to the
Contributor Task List.
2. In the Task List, select the task you want to work on, and the Task Accordion or Drawer will open
with more details.
3. In the Task Accordion details, look at the Forms section. Task forms that have Concurrent
Contributor enabled have a special icon next to View Page Options In Use :


4. Next to this task form, on the right, you will see a split Input Data button. Select the left part of
this button (the part with the Input Data  label).
 •  If the Input Data button that you see is not split, see method two.


59



5. This will download and open the task form in Excel as normal. As soon as it loads in Excel, the
Choose box  will appear:




6. Use the Choose box  to select the page option(s) you want to use. As soon as you select OK, the
page option(s) you chose will be in your name and loaded in Excel.
7. If the page option(s) you have selected are already in use by another Contributor, you will see an
error message. If you see this error message, you have a few options. You can:
• Select Yes to view the selected page options in View mode , i.e. view data, but not save any
inputs (the  Save Data  button will be disabled);
• Select No and return to the Choose menu to choose different page options.
• Select No and close Excel to wait until the page options you want are available again.

8. If you want to see which page options are currently in use, and by whom, return to the Task Details
in your browser and select the arrow section of the Input Data button:

1. Log in to Vena. If you are not taken there by default, select Tasks to go to the Task List.
2. In the Task List, select the task you want to work on, and the Task Details will expand.
3. In the Task Drawer, the page options will be available to select. Task forms that have
Concurrent Contributor enabled have a special icon next to the form name.



4. Here, use the drop -down menu(s) to select the page option(s) that you want to use, then
select Download:


62




5. This will open the selected page option(s) in your name, and the task form will download and
opened in Excel.
6. If the page option(s) you have selected are already in use by another Contributor, you will see an
error message.
7. If you see this error message, select OK to choose different page options, or to return to the Task
Drawer to wait until the page options you want are available again.
• If you would like to see which page options are currently in use, and by whom, select the View
Page Options In Use link in the Task Details.
8. After you have successfully opened page options, simply use the task form as normal.

9. When you are finished, save your inputs (if applicable) and close Excel. When you are prompted
whether you want to return the file, select Yes to return the page options.
• Alternatively, you can allow others to use the page options when you've completed your tasks by
selecting Return File  in the Task Drawer in the Tasks tab.



63

10. After the file has opened, simply use the task form as normal.
11. When you are finished, save your inputs  (if applicable) and close Excel. When you are prompted
whether you want to return the file, you can do so.
• Alternatively, you can also return the file in the Vena Tasks interface.
