About This Guide
Welcome to Vena: This guide is intended for Vena users in the Contributor role . If you have been
given this guide, that likely includes you!
You probably have a few questions, such as:
● What is Vena?
● What does a Contributor do?
● Will this take long?
This guide will answer those questions and more. It is designed to  teach you what you need to know to
quickly get up and running as a Contributor in Vena.
To help you navigate the modules, we have set three recommended paths through this guide based
on common use cases . These provide a good starting point, but of course you can also pick and choose
your own path —or simply read this guide all the way through, if you like.


A note on web links
This guide was designed to be distributed in digital form  (as a PDF file). As a result, it
includes several web links to related materials in Vena’s Knowledge Base. If you’ve
been given this guide in a printed format , you can still use these links by going to

What does Vena do?
Maybe this sounds familiar: your
planning process revolves around
spreadsheets, and it routinely grinds to a
halt when nobody on the team can figure
out which version of the spreadsheet is
the most rece nt one.
Sometimes, there are even several totally
different spreadsheets floating around.
We call this situation spreadsheet hell , and
it’s all too common in many
organizations. That’s why Vena provides a solution to
eliminate this frustrating phenomenon, making
spreadsheet -driven business processes easier, faster,
and just all -around more pleasant for everyone
involved.
How does Vena work?
For most people, the term “spreadsheet” immediately brings one
thing to mind: Excel1.
Excel is everywhere. That’s great – everyone knows how to use Excel. But
because it’s so popular, we use it for all kinds of complex processes for
which it wasn’t really designed. And since Excel can’t do important
things like version control or process management, this can often lead
to chaos and confusion.
The thing is, we know that you don’t want to learn how to use some other
tool: despite its limitations, you’d rather keep using Excel, because you’re
already familiar with it. We felt the same way, and that’s why Vena’s approach is
to embrace Excel – not replace it.
Rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, Vena enhances Excel by adding
the things it lacks: a central database, version control, workflow
integration, and a whole suite of useful features for analysis and
collaboration.

Where do I come in?

You will be using Vena as a Contributor . This is one of the handful of different user roles in
Vena, each of which revolves around a specific set of activities (some others you will see
mentioned are Manager , Modeler  and Admin ).

As a Contributor , you will use Vena to work on one or more of the following types of tasks :
● Input Tasks : Doing data entry on spreadsheets (such as budgets or forecasts)
● Review Tasks : Checking data inputs made by other users
● Report Tasks : Consuming financial or other types of reports created using Vena data
When you’re assigned to a task, you are also given one of three levels of responsibility: the Owner is
responsible for the task’s completion and signing off on it; a Support Worker helps an Owner to
complete a task; and a Watcher is a stakeholder who monitors a task but is not directly involved with
working on it.


Because Vena builds on Excel, using it should feel familiar: with Vena, you’ll still use Excel
spreadsheets to do things like entering your budget numbers, just as you have always done.


However, with Vena, those spreadsheets are now connected to an online database . That
means that any data you enter in a Vena spreadsheet is saved to the database , not in the
Excel file itself. Whenever you open a Vena spreadsheet, it will automatically pull the latest
data for that spreadsheet directly from the database. This ensures that everyone
automatically has the latest version of that spreadsheet , every time.


Vena also distributes the spreadsheets you need to
complete your tasks; no more digging through
email chains to find them. Instead, a web-based
interface will show you only those files that are
relevant to you, in a clear task -list format. Just open
any task to download its associated spreadsheets,
along with instructions on what you need to do.



It’s not just spreadsheets
You’re most likely to use Excel spreadsheets with
Vena, but other types of files, including Word
documents and even PowerPoint presentations,
can be used with Vena too.

9
If you’re responsible for reviewing work others have done, you’ll also do that directly in Vena. Your
workflows are built right into the interface, so if you’re looking over the numbers and notice an error, you
can just kick the spreadsheet straight back to the person responsible with a single click.

10
How do I use Vena?
Let’s start with a high -level look at how you’ll use Vena in practice. Vena consists of two main parts: a web
app and a  Vena Desktop  pane.


The Vena web app
The Vena web app  is where your business processes are tracked and managed. Think of it as a hub
where you can see the Vena tasks you need to work on.
These tasks are presented as a to -do list and selecting  any task allows you to see details about it
(including instructions, comments left on the task by other users, etc.).

Each task contains task forms . These are the files you’ll use to complete the task. When talking about
task forms, we also sometimes use the more specific terms input template , which is a spreadsheet that
accepts data inputs, and report , which is a read -only spreadsheet  that displays data but can’t be used to
change that data.

Because you will often be using the same spreadsheets as other users when you input data, it’s
important to avoid data conflicts. That’s why when you’re inputting data in a task form , the file will be
In Use .

When you’re inputting data in a  task form , the file is In Use  and only you can use it. When
you are no longer using the file , you can Return File  to make it available to others again.

11

Finally, when you have finished a
task, you complete it by
submitting it.
Submitting a task creates a
corresponding review task (for
another Contributor to check your
work); you may also perform
reviews. Just as with input tasks, this
involves downloading task forms to
review the data on them. Depending
on how the review goes, you can
then choose to accept or reject the task right in the Vena
web app.
The Vena Excel Desktop
When you download a spreadsheet from Vena, it’ll open in Excel —just like you’d expect. But unlike
normal spreadsheets, the ones you download from Vena are connected to your Vena database .
To make this happen, we use an Excel Add -in, which is an app that plugs into  Excel to extend its
functionality. In Vena’s case, it looks like an extra tab in the menu ribbon at the top of Excel. This tab is
automatically displayed whenever you open a Vena file:

The main purpose of Vena Desktop  is to essentially turn Excel into powerful database software while
still looking and working like Excel. This makes learning how to use Vena easy because you can build on
the Excel expertise that you already have.
We’ll show you how to use all the important features of Desktop  in a later module. For now, here’s a
brief rundown of some of the things it allows you to do in Excel:
● Write data inputs to the database: Enter data into designated input fields on a
Vena -enabled spreadsheet, then save it back to the database with one click.
● Refresh data: At any time, get the most up -to-date data from your database on the
spreadsheet you’re currently using.
● Switch between different datasets : View related datasets (like prior year actuals vs. this year’s
budget) without having to open another spreadsheet. Plus, view different datasets side -by-side
for comparison.
● Add more detail to line items : Need to give a detailed breakdown of a budget figure? Break

12
it down to provide more granular information.
● Additional features : Leave comments for other users, see a history of changes on a file, drill into
historical and transactional data, and upload/download files to and from your database.


13
What’s next?
Now that you know what Vena is and how it works, let’s get started! Over the next few modules, we’ll
make sure you have everything you need, then look at how to use the Vena web app and Desktop .





What to do if you need help
We’ve done our best to include everything you need to know as a Contributor in this guide. But even so, it’s
always possible that you might run into something we didn’t cover .
If you get stuck at any point and can’t find the answer in this guide, don’t worry! Your best resource for
help is usually your organization’s Vena Power Users (who probably gave you this guide). Get in touch
with them, and they should be able to help you out of most jams.

Module 2: Getting Ready to Use Ven a ⧫ ⬤ ■
Overview
Ready to begin using Vena? Learn about what you’ll need to get started.
This is an instructional module : it contains a guide on how to perform a task or action  in Vena.


Reading Time
This module will take about 2 minutes to read (3 pages ).


Topics
This module covers the following topics:
● Requirements for using Vena
● How to log in


Choose Your Path
This module is recommended for:
• Path I: Report Consumer ⧫
• Path II: Data Entry  ⬤
• Path III: Reviewer ■

15
What You’ll Need
→ Your Vena login creden tials
This is the email address and password combination you use to log in to Vena. The email is usually the
same as your work email, and a temporary password should have been provided to you. If you’re not
sure about your login details, check with your organization’s Vena Power User, or your IT department.

→ A major browser
To use the Vena web app, you’ll need a major browser like Google Chrome  (recommended), Mozilla
Firefox or Microsoft Edge/Internet Explorer. Ideally, you should be running the latest version of your
chosen browser. If you use Internet Expl orer, it must be at least version 10 or later.

→ Microsoft Excel
Of course, you’ll need Excel. Vena will work with Windows 07 at a minimum , but we recommend using
at least Windows 10 , updated to the latest version.  After you've logged in to Vena , you can use this link
to view the latest system requirements.

→ Vena Desktop  for Excel
Usually, your IT department should have already i nstalled this  on your computer. It’s easy to check if
Vena Desktop  is already installed. Just open Excel (any file or even a blank new workbook will do), and
look at the menu bar:


If you see a Vena  ribbon  in the menu bar (like in the image above),  you have Vena Desktop . Don’t
worry that there isn’t much on it right now —once you’ve opened a Vena -connected file, the full menu will
be visible.


16
           Got everything? Then let’s log in to Vena.

Don’t see the Vena tab in Excel?
The Vena  Desktop might not be installed , or perhaps something went wrong during
installation and it needs to be reinstalled.
Because many organizations don’t permit individual employees to install software by
themselves, this guide does not include installation instructions for Vena Desktop .
Instead, we recommend that you contact your IT department for help if you do
not have Vena Desktop  on your computer, or if it’s not working.

17
Logging In
Whenever we talk about “logging in to Vena”, this means  logging in to the Vena web app on the vena.io
website. The web app is the starting point for everything you do in Vena ( even the parts for which
you’ll use Excel).


How to log in to Vena:
1. Open your browser (we recommend Google Chrome) and type vena.io into the address bar.
Press Enter .



2. This will bring up the Vena login page. Use the fields provided to type in your Vena login
credentials: your email address  and password :




3. Now, select  the Log In  button. If you entered your credentials correctly, you should see
the Vena Tasks interface, indicating that you have logged in successfully:


18
4. If this is your first time logging in to Vena, you likely used a temporary password . After you
enter your temporary password, you may be directed to a landing page where you’ll update
your password. However, if you are not redirected, you can change your password from within
Vena.
5. To update your password, select your name in the top right corner of the page:



6. This will open your  Profile . Navigate to the Password  tab and follow the instructions to change your
password.

7. Select  Change Password  when you’re done, and you’ll see a confirmation that the password was
changed successfully.


8. You’re all set and can now begin using the Vena web app to work on your tasks.

 A Look at the Vena Tasks Interface
Welcome to the Tasks  Interface of the Vena web app! Whenever you log in to Vena, it’s the first
thing you’ll see. Your Tasks Interface should look something like this:




The Tasks Interface displays your Vena tasks  and makes available all the task forms (i.e.,
spreadsheets) that you’ll use to work on those tasks.
A. Task List: The focal point of the Contributor Interface, a listing of all your tasks, categorized and
sorted based on their due date.

B. Task Type: This indicates whether the tasks relate to inputs, reviews, or reports .

C. Process Status Filter: Instead of just active tasks, choose to view other categories of tasks, such
as those that belong to processes which are currently inactive (completed or paused), haven’t
started yet, or all tasks that have ever been assigned to you, past, present, and future.

D. T ask Search: Use keywords to search for specific tasks .

E. My Status button: View a dashboard with a high -level overview of your Vena tasks. Displays
statistics around your number of tasks, when you worked on them, comparison of tasks by type,
which one you last worked on, etc.



21
 F. Task Drawer: Opens when you select  any task to display more information about it. Contains all
the details about a task, including download links for task forms, instructions, supporting
documents, etc. as well as task -specific actions  like submitting tasks or approving/rejecting
reviews.



22
 Module 4: Using the Task List ⬤ ■

23

Managing Your Tasks
In the Tasks  Interface, everything revolves around your Task List. By default, it shows all your active
tasks, along with some further information about the task such as when it’s due. It will look something
like this:















How to read and manage the Task List:
Task Categories
Your tasks are divided into Task Categories based on  urgency . You can filter the task category by selecting it.

● To Do: Current tasks that are ready for you to work on, and whose due date is still in the future.


● Upcoming  Tasks that are upcoming, but not yet ready  because they haven’t been reached in
your process yet.


● View Only: Tasks (often reports) that don’t require any action on your part  and are available to
view at any time.

● Overdue:  Tasks  with a deadline that is past due.
●

24

Task Types
Next to each task, you’ll see an icon indicating what type of task it is:
● Input: Enter data on a spreadsheet.
● Review: Check inputs made by other Contributors for accuracy.
● Report: View financial and other types of reports.


Sorting the Task List
You can choose to sort the task list by any of the columns in ascending or
descending order. To do that, just select  the arrows next to each column
header .


Viewing a Task
To view any task, just select it . The Task Details will expand to display that task’s details:














You can switch between tasks by selecting a different one .

25

Filtering & Searching Your Task List
Making your Task List work for you is key, and there are a few ways you can find things more quickly , including
customizing which tasks appear in the list .


How to filter and search the Task List:
Filtering by Task Type
Want to only see tasks of a specific type , and
nothing else? Use the Task Type Filter in the
sidebar on the left.
Just select  the type of task you want to see, and all
tasks that aren’t of the selected type will be hidden.
To see all types of tasks again, select  the All option.

Process  Filtering

For more granular filtering  of processes , use the Process
Filter . These allow you to customize your Task List based
on process status and process name .



Why does my Task List look different?
The columns you see in your Task List might not be the same as the ones shown in these
screenshots. That’s because your Vena Manager has the option to customize them . You can
too! Find out how in Appendix A at the end of this guide.

26

Searching
To search for tasks matching one or more keywords , just start typing into the search box . The search
function will auto -suggest tasks , processes (the major business processes that your tasks are part of, like
Annual Budgeting ) or activities (sub -sections of processes, like Marketing Budget ).

• Tasks  that have been assigned to you, like Corporate Budget Review
• Processes that your tasks are part of, like Annual Budgeting
• Activities which are sub -sections of processes, like Department Budget Input

28

Opening a Task
In Vena, the files you use to work on your tasks are called task forms . To access the files you need, the
first step is to open the task it’s attached to. Here, you’ll also find more information about the task
itself.


How to open a task:
A. To get started on a task, select  the task .


B. Selecting the task opens up the task details . Here you’ll find basic information about the task,
such as who is assigned to work on it, and what their level of responsibility is ( Owner , Support
Worker or Watcher ).
C. Next, read any attachments to find out what you need to do to complete the task:

D. Now, go to the Template Name  section . It lists the files (task forms) that you’ll use to complete
this task. We’ll look at how to download task forms in the next section.






29

Downloading Task Forms
To work on a task, you will need to download and open its task forms in Excel .
● Any task form that can be used for data entry must not already be in use before you can
download it. When you begin inputting data in a task form  that means that only you can work
on it  (unless your Manager has enabled the Concurrent Contributor option – see Appendix C in
this guide) which prevents conflicting inputs . When you select Input Data for a task form, it will
start downloading automatically .
● Task forms that can’t be used for data entry are view -only . This means that you can just
download (or “view”) them directly. Reports are always view -only.


How to download a task form:
1. In the Task Drawer, choose the task form you want to work on.

2. Select the task name to expand it . Select  Input  to start your download :



What about the arrow (>) button?
The main part  of the Input /View  buttons immediately downloads the task form, so
it’s the preferred option for most users.
Selecting  the arrow (>) section of the button shows you additional options that
aren’t necessary for most users. If you want to learn more, look at Appendix A
at the end of this guide.

30
 3. The task form will now automatically begin to download .

4. Once the download is finished (which should only take a few seconds), select  the
downloaded file to open the task form in Excel.

5. Excel will open, and you should also see a Vena loading bar. Once everything has finished
loading, the contents of the task form will be displayed, and the Vena Desktop  menu ribbon
will be visible at the top of the Exce l window.

6. Your task form is now in use and open in Excel, so y ou can begin working on it . To do that, you’ll
use Vena Desktop in Excel .

 A Look at Vena Desktop in Excel
When you open a Vena task form in Excel, Vena  will appear in the Excel menu ribbon automatically. It
looks like this:

This is the Desktop  menu ribbon , and it works essentially like any other Excel menu. It consists of six
sections , each of which contains several related features and functions. These are:
A. Connections:
• Close : Allow you to close and disconnect the Vena Desktop .
•  Settings : Desktop  options.
• Key Info : View database -specific details for certain cells on the spreadsheet.

B. Data:
• Save Data : Used to save data inputs that you make on the spreadsheet.
• Refresh : Repopulate the spreadsheet with the most up -to-date data from the database.

C. Point of View:
• Choose : Used on spreadsheets configured with multiple, switchable datasets to either
swap between them
• Cascade : View multiple datasets in separate worksheets .
• Zoom In/Zoom Out: These d on’t zoom  in and out on the spreadsheet, but rather are used
with some types of data tables to see more or less granular data.

D. Line Item Details  (LIDs) :
• Insert : Insert Line Item Details.
• Remove : Remove Line Item Details.
• Multi -Insert:  Insert multiple Line Item Details.
• Select : Select specific Line Item Details.
• Move Selected : Allows you to move selected LIDs See Appendix B for more information.

E. Audit:
• Audit Trail: See a history of changes made using this spreadsheet.
• Drill Down:  Dig into more granular data, for example by drilling from an overall Q2 figure
to separate April, May and June numbers.
• Drill Saves:  See a history of data values saved to any data cell on the spreadsheet.
• Drill Transactions:  View the transactional data underlying a value, if available.

33


F. Tools:
• Comments : Leave comments on specific database intersections .
• Intersection Files : Upload files to Vena database intersections .





What about updates?
To make it easy to update, Vena Desktop  automatically checks for
updates whenever you use it. Whenever Vena detects that an update
is available, an Update button will appear in the Vena ribbon .
Simply click on the Update button to update your Desktop . If you do
not see the Update  button in the ribbon, then you know you’re using
the latest version of the Desktop .

 Working with Vena Spreadsheets
Whether you use Vena spreadsheets to do data entry, data review, or simply to look at reports, the good
news is that the experience is almost the same as using a normal spreadsheet . All the normal Excel
functionality that you’re used to is there and works just as you expect.
Of course, a Vena spreadsheet opens with the Vena Desktop  menu active, and this offers additional
functionality that’s not available on a traditional spreadsheet.


Essential Desktop  Functions
For all types of Vena users, the two most important functions in the Vena Desktop  menu are Choose
and Refresh . With these functions, you can:
● Switch between different datasets on the same spreadsheet  (Choose )
● Get the latest available data (Refresh)


Using Choose
There are all kinds of situations where you might want to see a version of the same spreadsheet with
different numbers. For example, you might want to view the same report, but with last year’s figures for
comparison.
In Vena, a single spreadsheet can be configured to display multiple sets of data,  which we refer to as
page options . On spreadsheets where page options are available, the Choose  function  allows you to
select between them.
In fact, the Choose  menu is the first thing you’ll see  when you download any spreadsheet that has page
options:



36

All you must do is use the dropdown menu(s) to choose the page option(s)  you want to view, then select
OK. There will be a separate dropdown menu for each dimension (or “category” of data) you can choose
from.
Want to switch to a different set of page options  later? Just select  the Choose  button  in the Vena menu
ribbon at any time to open the page options menu again:









Why is the Choose button not working?
The Choose button in the Vena menu will only be active if the designer of the
spreadsheet has set up different page options for you to choose from.
If you can only view one dataset on the spreadsheet you’re currently using, the
Choose  button will be disabled (greyed out).

37

Using Refresh
To make sure you’re looking at the most recent data, just
select  the Refresh  button  in the Vena menu ribbon at any
time.
Vena will check with your database to see if there have
been any changes and will update the spreadsheet
accordingly.


Other Important Desktop  Functions
In addition to the essential functions  that we’ve looked at above, you can get even more from your Vena
spreadsheets by using the optional Cascade , Audit Trail , Drill and MDR Insert Row functions. With
these functions, you can:
● Cascade: View multiple page options side -by-side on different tabs (or in separate files) to switch
between them rapidly and repeatedly
● Audit Trail: See a history of changes made to the spreadsheet, and view and compare
historical versions of  that spreadsheet
● Drill: Extract related, contextual data that is not on the spreadsheet from your Vena database
● MDR Insert Row:  Add rows  to a dynamically mapped template

Path II: Data Entry  ⬤

39
 Making & Saving Data Inputs
Using a Vena task form to do data entry is easy: open a file in Excel , you simply type your numbers into
the appropriate cells,  then save the data  – just like on a normal spreadsheet. (When they are used for
data entry, we al so use the term input template to describe these task forms.)
However, there is a small but important difference  between Vena
spreadsheets and normal ones: on a Vena input template, the Excel
Save button won’t save your data inputs !
Remember: in Vena, your spreadsheets are connected to a
database. When you save data on a Vena spreadsheet, you’re saving
that data directly to the database.  To do this, you’ll need to use
Vena’s Save Data  function,  which is built into Vena Desktop .


How to make and save data inputs on a Vena spreadsheet:
1. With the spreadsheet open in Excel, find the cells where you are supposed to make inputs.  The
designer of the spreadsheet will often highlight them in some way. In the screenshot below, for
example, the input cells are highlighted in  blue :



2. Now, just type your data inputs into these cells,  just like you would on any other Excel spreadsheet.

40
 3. When you’re finished (or any time you want to save your progress), select  the Save Data  button
in the Vena ribbon to save your inputs to the Vena database:


4. You may get a pop -up that asks you to confirm the save. select  Yes to save your data.




5. A pop -up will appear to indicate that the data is being saved. Once it’s done, you
should see a confirmation that the data has been saved successfully :





What about Line Item Details?
On some input tasks, you may be asked to use Line Item Details . If you need to use Line Item
Details as part of your input task, please see Appendix B at the end of this guide to learn more
about this feature.

41
 Closing a Vena Task Form
Once you’re finished making inputs and have saved your work, select the  Close button to close the file.

When you close Excel, you’ll be asked if you want to check the task form back in . Select  Yes to ensure
that other users can use this task form again.



(If you select  No, don’t worry – you can also return the file from the Vena web app by selecting  Return File in the
Task Drawer.)

42
 Module 9:  Submitting Completed Tasks ⬤

Overview
Return to the Vena web app and learn how to submit completed tasks for review.
This is an instructional module : it contains a guide on how to perform a task or action  in Vena.


Reading Time
This module will take about 3 minutes to read (3 pages).


Topics
This module covers the following topics:
● Submitting a data entry task for review
● Resubmitting rejected tasks


Choose Your Path
This module is recommended for:
Path II: Data Entry  ⬤

43
 Submitting a Task
When you have completed  all your assigned  task forms and entered and saved the required data,
there’s just one more step to completing the task: submitting it . In most cases, submitting the task
means submitting it for review , where another user checks your work as part of your process
workflow. And since your process is built into Vena, you submit your tasks right from the Vena web app.

How to submit a task:
1. Return to the Vena
web app (at vena.io )
and view your Task List.
Find the task you have
just completed and
want to submit. Select it
to expand it.



2. Select the  Submit  button. A confirmation window will appear. Select  Yes to proceed with
submitting the task.
Who can submit a task?
It’s common for multiple people to work on a single task. So, who submits it?
First, only Task Owners are responsible for submitting tasks. If you have been assigned to a task as a
Support Worker or Watcher , you don’t need to worry about submitting it.
If you’re one of multiple Task Owners on the task, you or any other Task Owner can submit the task, it’s
a good idea for everyone to coordinate before submitting.

44
 3. That’s it! Your task is now submitted for review . The Status  on the task will change to Under
Review , and the task will move in your Task List from the To Do section to the View Only
section.





Rejected Tasks
Well done, you’ve completed a task! Your work will now be reviewed.
But you might not be done  quite yet: the person reviewing your task might reject it, for example if they
find an error. If this happens, you’ll need to return to the task to correct the issue and resubmit it.

How to resubmit a rejected input task:
1. A rejected submission gets added back to the To Do section of your Task List , where it is listed with the
status Rejected :



2. Select the task  to open the Task D etails . Here, select Comments  to see the reason why it was
rejected:




3. Select the Forms  tab to work on the appropriate task forms  to resolve the issue.


45




4. When you’re done, you have two options:
• You can submit the task by selecting the Finish Input  button in the open Excel spreadsheet; or
• You can use the Submit button in vena.io.

  If you submit via vena.io, select the Submit  button  in the Task Drawer again to resubmit the task .

When a task has been approved , you’ll see that its status in the Task List changes from Under Review  to
Approved, and be listed as Approved .

Module 10:  Reviewing Data  ■
Overview
Learn how to review data inputs made by other users.
This is an instructional module : it contains a guide on how to perform a task or action in Vena.


Reading Time
This module will take about 3 minutes to read (3 pages ).


Topics
This module co vers the following topics:
● Reviewing a data entry task
● Approving or rejecting tasks


Choose Your Path
This module is recommended for:
● Path III: Reviewer  ■


47
 Reviewing Data Inputs
If you have been assigned a review task , you will review data entry work don e by other users, checking
for errors and compliance with applicable rules. To do this, you will use the same spreadsheets that were
used to make the data inputs, as you would when reviewing a normal spreadsheet. Of course, with Vena,
you are guaranteed to always be looking at the latest version automatically.

How to perform a review in Vena:
1. With the spreadsheet open in Excel, review it according to your organization’s guidelines .


2. If you encounter any errors, you may be able to make corrections yourself  if the task form is
set up to allow this. Here’s how to check:
● If you select ed Input Data  to download the task form, you :
•  Can make changes yourself.
• If this is the case, see Module 8: Entering Data for
instructions.

● If you selected  View to do wnload the task form, you :
• Will not be able to make changes yourself.
• Instead, use the Reject function  to send the task back to
the submitter to make the necessary changes.

48
 ●
3. Once you have finished your review, just close Excel by selecting  the Close  button . If you were
working on a spreadsheet that you had to check out before downloading, you’ll be asked if you
want to check the task form back in ( select  Yes):


4. Download and review the next task form from the Vena web app. Repeat this process until you have
reviewed all the task forms  attached to the task.

49
 Approving and Rejecting Reviews
If you identified that changes are needed during your review, and you were unable to make these
changes yourself, you can reject the task  back to the original submitter.

If everything was fine, you can approve the task , which will complete it and advance your Vena
workflow.
You can approve or reject a task at any time. Keep in mind that this will approve or reject the entire
task – you can’t reject only specific task forms .


How to approve or reject a review:
1. Return to the Vena web app (at vena.io ) and find the review task you just worked on. Select it to
expand it:


2. In the bottom right, find the Approve and Reject  buttons :
3. If you need to reject the review, select the Reject  button.  This will reassign the task back to the
user(s) who submitted it so that they can make the necessary changes.

50
 4. When you select  the Reject button, you will see a confirmation pop -up, along with a text box
where you can provide details for the rejection.  Select Yes, Reject Task  to proceed:
• Entering a rejection reason may be optional or mandatory, depending on your Vena
settings. Even if it is optional , it is best practice to provide a reason.

5. The rejected task will be moved in your Task List from the To Do  section to the Coming Soon
section , with the status Rejected .


6. If the review did not turn up any issues,  you can simply approve it by selecting the Approve
button . As with rejecting a task, selecting  Approve will bring up a confirmation pop -up. Select
Yes, A pprove Task  to proceed .

7. Once a review on a task has been approved, it is considered completed. Completed
tasks are added to the View Only  section  of the Task List and marked with the status
Approved .

 Appendix A : Additional Web App Features
This appendix describes additional functionality in the Vena web app  which was not covered in any of the earlier
modules.
These features are optional  and are recommended for users who want to take advantage of all
available functionality.


Customizing Task List Columns
In Module 4 , we mentioned that the appearance of your Task List might be different from the
screenshots in this guide. This is because the columns shown in the Task List can be modified . Here’s
how to do that:
1. In the Task List, locate the header bar that contains the column headings. On the left side, you should
see a small gear icon.





2. Select the gear  icon,  which will open a menu:


52
 3. This menu displays all the available columns. To customize your columns,  select  any columns
you want to make visible in the Task List. Columns selected to be displayed will have a
checkmark beside them.
4. Select any currently visible column to remove it from your Task List.  This will remove the
green highlight and checkmark.
5. When you select (add) or unselect (remove) a column , the change is reflected in the Task List
instantly, and is also saved automatically.
• Note that these changes only apply to your own Task List,  not those of other users.
6. Select anywhere within the Task List  to close the menu .


















53

Appendix B:  Additional Vena Desktop  Features
This appendix describes additional functionality in Vena Desktop  for Excel which was not covered in
any of the earlier modules.
These features are optional and are recommended for users who want to take advantage of all available
functionality, or whose Vena tasks require the use of these features.


Line Item Details
In Module 8, we mentioned that, for some input tasks,  you might be asked to use the Line Item Details
feature.  This feature is used whenever more granular detail on a data input is required.

For example, you might need to break down a generic item
like “Travel Expense” into separate line items like “Flight”,
“Lodging”, “Car Rental”, etc.
With Line Item Details , you can enter these individual line
items onto the spreadsheet , and they are automatically
summed to the main item .


Line Item Details ( or LIDs for short) live in their own section of the
Vena Desktop menu ribbon , which we briefly looked at in the
overview in Module 6 . If LIDs have been enabled on the task form
(input template) that you’re using,  the functions in this section will
allow you to add and remove LIDs, as well as move them around  on
the spreadsheet, if needed.


Since the Line Item Details  feature has to be specifically enabled on an input task form to be used, the
designer of the task form will usually note in the task instructions ( or sometimes on a cover sheet in the
task form itself)  if you should use LIDs when making inputs.
To learn how to use  Line Item Details on your input tasks, please see this article on the Vena
Knowledge Base :
● How -To: Working with Line  Item Details as a Contributor

54

Intersection Comments
In Vena, you can add comments in the web app to
a task —but you can also add them directly within a
spreadsheet  using the Vena Desktop ’s Comments
feature . When you have multiple people working
together, using this feature can help to keep
everyone coordinated.
The smart thing about comments made via the
Desktop is that, unlike Excel comments, they are
not specific to the spreadsheet. Instead, they are
saved directly to database intersections (or Line Item
Details ), which are unique locations in your Vena
database where individual data values are also
stored.
In other words, when you leave a comment on a
cell in a Vena spreadsheet, that comment is
attached to the value in that cell. As a result, no
matter where that value appears, the
comment will appear too —even if it’s on a
completely different spreadsheet than where
the comment was made.

If you’d like to learn more about the Desktop ’s Comments feature and how to use it, please refer
to this article on the Vena Knowledge Base :
● How -To: Commenting on templates ( Desktop  Comments)


Why can’t I use the Comments feature?
The Comments  button might be disabled (greyed out) for you, which means that you
can’t use it. This is usually because your Vena Admin has turned off this feature .

55

Intersection Files
Values (and comments) are not the only types of data that
can be stored in a Vena database intersection. You can also
store entire files (including spreadsheets, documents,
slide decks, etc.) in your Vena database .
To do this, you can use the Intersection Files feature built
into Vena  Desktop , which allows you to both upload and
download files to and from your Vena database .



To learn how the Desktop ’s Intersection Files feature works, and how to use it, please see this
article on the Vena  Knowledge Base :
• How -To: Saving files to Vena database intersections

56
 Appendix C:  Concurrent Contributor
This appendix describes the Concurrent Contributor option that is available in Vena.
These features are optional  and are recommended for users who want to take advantage of all
available functionality, or whose Vena tasks require the use of these features.


What is Concurrent Contributor

In Vena,  inputting data in a task form as a Contributor means that you are "reserving" it: if a task
form is being used by you , no one else can work on it. Because only one person can use a task
form at any given time, this helps to prevent conflicting inputs and version control issues.
However, it also means that other Contributors who need to use the same form must wait until it
is available again.
Concurrent C ontributor is an optional feature that Vena Managers can enable on task forms.
Instead of the entire task form being In Use as normal, Concurrent Contributor allows you to
use only a specific set of page options .

This means that multiple users can work on a task form at the same time : when one set of page
options is being used , this still leaves the remaining page options available for other users. For
task forms with many users, this can save a lot of time - you don't need to wait your turn to use
the file , because you can just work on it at the same time as everyone else.

How to

The process for using a Concurrent Contributor task form will work slightly differently depending on
the Template Property  that was set on it by your Vena Manager, as well as whether or not you are using
Windows.
Use the appearance of the  In Use  button in the Contributor Task Accordion to determine which
instructions to use:

Method One: Central & Standalone Instructions  for
using Concurrent Contributor task form

Use these instructions if you know that the template you are using is a Central or Standalone
template, or if the  Input Data  button on the task form is split into two parts like this:

To use a Concurrent Contributor task form (Central/Standalone templates) :
1. Log in to Vena. If you are not taken there by default, select  Tasks  or Contributor  to go to the
Contributor Task List.
2. In the Task List, select the task you want to work on, and the Task Accordion or Drawer will open
with more details.
3. In the Task Accordion details, look at the Forms section. Task forms that have Concurrent
Contributor enabled have a special icon next to  View Page Options In Use :



4. Next to this task form, on the right, you will see a split  Input Data  button. Select the left part of this
button (the part with the  Input Data  label).
• If the  Input Data  button that you see is  not split, see method two.


58

5. This will download and open the task form in Excel as normal. As soon as it loads in Excel,
the Choose  box will appear:



6. Use the  Choose  box to select the page option(s) you want to use. As soon as you select OK, the
page option(s) you chose will be in your name and loaded in Excel.

error message.  If you see this error message, you have a few options. You can:
• Select  Yes to view the selected page options in View mode , i.e. view data, but not save any inputs
(the Save Data  button will be disabled);
• Select  No and return to the  Choose  menu to choose different page options .
• Select  No and close Excel to wait until the page options you want are available again.

8. If you want to see which page options are currently in use , and by whom, return to the Task
Details in your browser and select the arrow section of the  Input Data  button:











59

9. This will open another section of the Task D etails  with more options. Here, select  View Page Options
In Use  link in the Task Drawer:



10. After you have successfully chosen your page options, use the task form as normal.
11. When you are finished, save your inputs (if applicable) and close Excel. You can also allow others
to use the page options when you’re finished your task by selecting Return File  in the Task Details in
the Vena Tasks interface .


60

Method Two: Hybrid Template Instructions  for using
Concurrent Contributor  task form


Use these instructions if you know that the template you are using is  a Hybrid  template, or if the  Inpt
Data button on the task form is a one -piece (not split) button with an arrow, like this:


To use a Concurrent Contributor task form (Hybrid templates):
1. Log in to Vena. If you are not taken there by default, select  Tasks to go to the Task List.
2. In the Task List, select the task you want to work on, and the Task Details will expand.
3. In the Task Drawer, the page options will be available to select. Task forms that have Concurrent
Contributor  enabled have a special icon next to the form name.








61

4. Here, use the drop -down menu(s) to select the page option(s) that you want to use, then select
Download:











5. This will open the selected page option(s) in your name, and the task form will download and opened in
Excel.
6. If the page option(s) you have selected are already in use by another Contributor, you will see an error
message.
7. If you see this error message, select  OK to choose different page options, or to return to the Task Drawer
to wait until the page options you want have been returned again.
• If you would like to see which page options are currently in use , and by whom, select the  View
Page Options In Use  link in the Task Details.
8. After you have successfully opened page options, simply use the task form as normal.

9. When you are finished, save your inputs (if applicable) and close Excel. When you are prompted whether
you want to return the file, select  Yes to return the page options.
• Alternatively, you can allow others to use the page options when you've completed your tasks by
selecting  Return File  in the Task Drawer in the Tasks tab.




62
 10. After the file has opened , simply use the task form as normal.
11. When you are finished, save your inputs (if applicable) and close Excel. When you are prompted whether
you want to return the file, you can do so.
• Alternatively, you can also return the file in the Vena Tasks interface.
