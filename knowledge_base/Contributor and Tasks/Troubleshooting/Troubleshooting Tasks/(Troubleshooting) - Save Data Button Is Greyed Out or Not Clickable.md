Suggested solution
There are multiple reasons that this could happen. Check the referenced articles and confirm if
the solutions solve your issue.
1. Troubleshooting: Template or Report is in View-Only Mode
2. Troubleshooting: R eviewer Unable to Save Data and Can Only Open T emplate as View-only
3. Troubleshooting: The T emplate Has Errors. Please Contact Y our Administrator
Some templates or reports are meant to be in a View-only mode and will not allow data saves
(i.e., the Save Data button will be greyed out). But if your template should actually allow data
saves, fix the corresponding issue and then re-open the template.
