appear as ".." before the "xlsx" file extension.
4. Rename the template by removing any extra periods or special characters.
5. Download the template.
6. Open the template.
7. Perform a data save to confirm the issue is resolved.
8. If the file name looks good and the issue persists, please contact the Vena Support team.
Cause
This can occur when server-side security flags the file as being suspicious due to double periods
or unusual characters in the file name.

Note
In V365-enabled processes, templates may return a "Processing Error". If this
happens, renaming the file to remove the periods in the file name will fix the issue.02/01/2026, 12:48 Troubleshooting: The Remote Server Returned (500) Internal Server Error When Saving Data – Vena Solutions
