Suggested solution 1: Value too low
This is an indication that you are violating a soft validation rule. By selecting Yes, the data will be
saved successfully. Data will not be saved if you select No. If you want to identify the cell with the
validation rule, visit the Viewing section of this article. Once you have identified the cell, you can
make necessary changes to pass the soft validation rule if needed.
