1. Navigate to your Vena Logs. Learn how to access Vena Logs in this article.
2. Locate the following warning in your logs:
<WARNING>: Multi-Dynamic Refresh - Some columns in section-block Details B2 are missing
dimensions. One or more uses 5 dimensions
<WARNING>: Skipping 1 MDR collection(s) in [Details B2] because of column mappings
This warning notes that the refresh was not completed due to incomplete dimension
mapping.
3. Clear the mapping or update the mapping to include all the dimensions.
4. Refresh the template.
