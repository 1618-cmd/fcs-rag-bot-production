Vena for MicrosoftThe distorted characters in the PDF are caused by the Adobe PDF setting that relies solely on
system fonts instead of embedding the document's fonts. When this option is checked, if the
system fonts don’t match those used in Excel, the text may appear distorted or incorrect in the
PDF.
