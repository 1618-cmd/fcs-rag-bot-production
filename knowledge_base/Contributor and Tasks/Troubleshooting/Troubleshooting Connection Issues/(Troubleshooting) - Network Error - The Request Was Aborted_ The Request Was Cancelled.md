Suggested solution
1. Log out of Vena.
2. Connect to a different network (e.g., tethering to your mobile phone's data).
3. Log back into Vena.
4. Re-download a template to check to see if you still receive the same error.
5. If you no longer receive the error, the issue is isolated to the original network that you were
connected to. Contact your IT Team, or if working from home, your broadband provider to
review your IP settings.02/01/2026, 12:19 Troubleshooting: Network Error - The Request Was Aborted: The Request Was Cancelled – Vena Solutions
