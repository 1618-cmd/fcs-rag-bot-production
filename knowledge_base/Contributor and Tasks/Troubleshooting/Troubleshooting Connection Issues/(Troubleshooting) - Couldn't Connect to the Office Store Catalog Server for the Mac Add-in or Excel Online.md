Suggested solution
1. Ensure you have linked your Microsoft account to Vena. Navigate to the Link Your Microsoft
Account to Vena section in this article.
2. Contact your organization's IT team to ensure they are not blocking access to the Office
Store. Ask your IT department to grant you access.
3. Your organization’s network policies may block Office Store access. Try accessing it on a
home network (with VPN off).
Cause
This could happen if your organization or IT has a policy/security setting blocking Office Store
access.02/01/2026, 12:17 Troubleshooting: Couldn't Connect to the Office Store Catalog Server for the Mac Add-in or Excel Online – Vena Solutions
