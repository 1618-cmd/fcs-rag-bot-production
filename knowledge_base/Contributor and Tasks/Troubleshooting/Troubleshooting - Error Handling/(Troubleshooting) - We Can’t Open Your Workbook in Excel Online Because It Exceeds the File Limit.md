Suggested solution
This is a limitation of Microsoft Excel Online due to the file reaching the maximum size. You can
open this file using the desktop version of Excel, where, you can either use the file or try to
reduce the size so it is below the limit specified in the official Microsoft Office Documentation.
Cause
This has been noted to happen in Excel Online/Office 365 due to the file size limit.
