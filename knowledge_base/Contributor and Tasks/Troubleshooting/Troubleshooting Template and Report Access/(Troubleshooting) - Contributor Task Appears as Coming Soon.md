Task Appears as Coming SoonSuggested solution
This happens if the task Owner in a step before yours has not yet submitted their task, or the
task is awaiting approval. Process workflows require completing the previous step before the
next one becomes available. Contact your Vena Admin to ensure the task before yours has been
submitted.
Your Admin can use the Status Tracker in the Manager tab to search for the previous task and
confirm its status.
Once the previous task has been completed, your task should move from the Coming Soon to the
To Do section.
Cause
A task appears in the Coming Soon section when the previous step in the process hasn't been
submitted yet.
