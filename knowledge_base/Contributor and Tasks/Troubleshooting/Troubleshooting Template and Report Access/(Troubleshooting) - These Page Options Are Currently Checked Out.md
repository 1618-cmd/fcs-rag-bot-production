4. Ensure you are not checking out the same or part of the same P age Options as another user. Users
cannot check out the file with any similar page options as those already checked out by another
user.
For example, say a template has three P age Options: Y ear, Department and Entity. If a user has
already checked out Y ear = 2050, Department = Finance and Entity = A GTY. This means the next
user must not make any of the same selections. Even if only one of the page options are the same,
a warning message will come up and the template will open in R ead-Only mode.
5. Make sure that the user has the appropriate data permissions to access the template. If not, they
may receive the same error message.
