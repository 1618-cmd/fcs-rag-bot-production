1. Check if this is a Report task.
Report tasks are designed for displaying data and are exclusively available as View-Only.
You'll see Report under the Type column in the task line:
2. Check and confirm if the task is in the Upcoming section.
This means your task is not ready to be completed yet - the previous tasks must be
completed first. This could also mean that the entire process has not yet started. Contact
your Vena Manager to confirm the process has started.
3. Check that the same template is not already in use by a different user.
A template will be View-Only if the task forms do not have Concurrent Contributor enabled.02/01/2026, 11:36 Troubleshooting: Template or Report is in View-Only Mode – Vena Solutions

5. Check if the task has already been submitted.
A submitted task will have Under Review next to it, and will be in the View Only tab.
If you have previously submitted the task but need to do more data entry, have the task
reviewer reject it. The task will return either to you or to your Vena Manager to be reset from
the Status Tracker page.
6. Look for the following message:"The current state of the process is paused. You cannot
submit any work to a process unless it is in the started state."
Contact your Vena Manager to confirm that the process is currently In Play and not paused. If02/01/2026, 11:36 Troubleshooting: Template or Report is in View-Only Mode – Vena Solutions

The Save Data button will be disabled when you open any template or report in
view-only mode. This is because the view-only mode does not allow for data entry or
