Suggested solution
Venamonitor.exe is an executable used to keep the Vena Desktop enabled in Excel.
At times, if Excel doesn't close down properly, it can potentially disable the Vena Desktop from
Excel. Venamonitor.exe makes sure that Vena is always enabled when a user launches Excel, and
if it's not, it will enable it from the Registries.
Please advise your IT team to add VenaMonitor.exe to the allow list on any group policies that
block executable files from running.
Location: C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\VenaSolutions\VenaMonitor.exe
Cause
This could happen if your company has a group policy or firewall that blocks executable files
from running.02/01/2026, 11:37 Troubleshooting: Venamonitor.exe - This Application Could Not Be Started – Vena Solutions
