Suggested solution
The Concurrent Contributor feature allows multiple Contributors to access the same template at
the same time, as long as the choose option(s) are different. The choose options make each
session unique, so if the template has no choose options, it will open in View-Only mode for all
users accessing it.
Contact your Vena Admin to either turn off the task's Concurrent Contributor feature or update
the template mapping to allow for choose options.
Choose options ensure that each Contributor can select unique options when opening the
template. They can also save their inputs, as long as the selected option is not already in use by02/01/2026, 11:40 Troubleshooting: The File Has No Page Options to Choose and Cannot Be Opened Using Concurrent Contributor – Vena Solutions
