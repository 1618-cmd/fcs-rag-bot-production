Keep in mind that inserting a Line-Item Details row on any table row that already contains
values will remove the existing values. As a best practice, you should generally add Line-
Item Details rows to any rows where they will be needed prior to beginning data input.
Note that the buttons in the Line-Item Details section of the Vena ribbon remain active even
when a template has no Blocks where Line-Item Details are enabled (or if the selected table
does not have Line-Item Details enabled). If you click on Insert to add a Line-Item Details Row
in a Block where the feature is disabled, nothing will happen.
LIDs creates a sum only when the Excel formatting for the intersections are formatted to
numbers or currency.
The parent row to which LID is added must be formatted as "Number" and cell must be kept
"Unlocked". Doing so will make sure that upon saving the template and refreshing it, Subtotal
formula is retained on the parent cell to roll up the LIDs values added to it.
When you initially insert LID row to a portion of your template, Vena will automatically insert
an additional hidden row under the visible LID row that was inserted. The additional row is
intentional so that the subtotal formulas for summing the LID values up to the intersection
will adjust automatically as LID rows are added. Values will not be saved in this hidden LID
row.
