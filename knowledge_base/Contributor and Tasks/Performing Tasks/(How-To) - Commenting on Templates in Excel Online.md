Function and SingleGetValueWith the introduction of the Comments functionality to the Vena Connector, we're bringing
Contributor functionality for Office 365 and Mac users closer to parity with Vena Desktop. You
can now add comments for any data intersection in a template, view comment threads and add
supporting documentation in the form of attachments to any cell.
How does it work?
Similar to the Comments feature in Vena Desktop, our Office 365 Comments functionality is built
into the Vena Connector, allowing users to comment on a template while viewing it in Excel
Online. Comments are tied to specific intersections or Line-Item Details (LIDS). As such,
comments added to an intersection in one template will be visible in all other templates
containing that specific intersection/LID. This ensures that all users have access to the
commentary associated with a data point no matter what template they are viewing.
Before you begin
To follow the instructions in this article and use the Comments feature in Excel Online, you will
need at least Contributor access and you will need to have connected your Microsoft account
with Vena. If you have not yet done so, please review the step-by-step instructions to sync your
Microsoft account.
If Data Permissions are set up in your environment, you will also need the appropriate
permissions (Read/Write) to work with the intersections/LIDs to which you want to add
comments.02/01/2026, 11:27 How-To: Commenting on Templates in Excel Online – Vena Solutions
