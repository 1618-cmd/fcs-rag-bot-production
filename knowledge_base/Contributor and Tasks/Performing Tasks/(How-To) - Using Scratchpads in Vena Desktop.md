Product UpdatesNotes & limitations
If your Manager has Concurrent Contributor enabled, any Scratchpad created will only be
saved to the page options that it was created in. If Concurrent Contributor is not enabled, any
Scratchpad created will be saved to the task and will appear on all page options.
Suppose a Scratchpad is created with Concurrent Contributor not enabled and later it is
enabled. In that case, the Scratchpad will be saved to all page options and any Scratchpad
created after Concurrent Contributor was enabled will only appear on the page option it was
created in.
If the template type is changed back to Central after Scratchpads are created, they will not be
lost. The Scratchpads will no longer be inserted when a template is opened from the task.
If the file hasn’t been saved since it was changed back to a Central template type, simply
switching the template type back to Hybrid will continue allowing the saved Scratchpads
to be inserted into the file load.
If the file has been saved, the Scratchpads will have to be recovered and restored from
the Audit Trail feature.
