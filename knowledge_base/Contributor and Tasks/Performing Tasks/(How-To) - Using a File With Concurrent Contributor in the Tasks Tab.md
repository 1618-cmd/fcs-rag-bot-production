In Vena, moving a task form to In Use as a Contributor means that you are "reserving" it: as long
as a task form is in use in your name, no one else can work on it. Because only one person can
use a task form at any given time, this helps to prevent conflicting inputs and version control
issues. However, it also means that other Contributors who need to use the same form have to
wait until it's available again.
Concurrent Contributor is an optional feature that Vena Managers can enable on particular
task forms. Instead of using the entire task form as normal, Concurrent Contributor allows you
to use only a specific set of page options. This means that multiple users can work on a task form
at the same time. When one set of page options is in use, this still leaves the remaining page
options available for other users to use. For task forms with many users, this can save a lot of
time - you don't need to wait your turn to use the form, because you can just work on it at the
same time as everyone else.
How is it different from the regular process?
The way you use a task form with Concurrent Contributor is almost identical to the regular
process, except that you may sometimes be unable to select specific page options because they
are already in use. You can identify a Concurrent Contributor task form using the following icon,
which appears next to the form in the Forms section of the Task Accordion or Drawer:02/01/2026, 11:26 How-To: Using a File With Concurrent Contributor in the Tasks Tab – Vena Solutions

When you see this icon, keep in mind that some page options may already be in use by other
users and therefore unavailable. In this article, we will cover how you can find out which page
options are already in use.
Before you begin
To follow the instructions in this article, you will need at least Contributor access.
The instructions also assume that you are using Windows for Excel and that you have the latest
version of the Vena Excel Desktop for Windows installed. Alternatively, you can also use Office
2016 for Mac or an Office 365 subscription (see the Notes section for details).02/01/2026, 11:26 How-To: Using a File With Concurrent Contributor in the Tasks Tab – Vena Solutions

How to
The process for using a Concurrent Contributor task form will work slightly differently depending
on the Template Property that was set on it by your Vena Manager, as well as whether or not
you are using Windows.
Use the appearance of the In Use button in the Contributor Task Accordion to determine which
instructions to use:
Input Data button looks like Template Property used Use these instructions
Central/Standalone Method One
Hybrid Method Two
Using a Concurrent Contributor task form (Method One)
Use these instructions if you know that the template you are using is a Central or Standalone
template, or if the Input Data button on the task form is split into two parts like this:02/01/2026, 11:26 How-To: Using a File With Concurrent Contributor in the Tasks Tab – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/18433401981709-How-To-Using-a-File-With-Concurrent-Contributor-in-the-Tasks-Tab 4/15

To use a Concurrent Contributor task form (Central/Standalone templates):
1. Log in to Vena. If you are not taken there by default, select Tasks or Contributor to go to the
Contributor Task List.
2. In the Task List, select the task you want to work on, and the Task Accordion or Drawer will
open with more details.
3. In the Task Accordion Drawer, look at the Forms section. Task forms that have Concurrent
Contributor enabled have a special icon (
) next to View Page Options In Use.
4. Next to this task form, on the right, you will see a split Input Data button. Select the left part
of this button (the part with the Input Data label).
If the Input Data button that you see is not split, see the instructions for Method Two
below.02/01/2026, 11:26 How-To: Using a File With Concurrent Contributor in the Tasks Tab – Vena Solutions

5. This will download and open the task form in Excel as normal. As soon as it loads in Excel, the
Choose menu will appear.
6. Use the Choose menu to select the page option(s) you want to use. As soon as you select
OK, the page option(s) you chose will be in your name and loaded in Excel.
7. If the page option(s) you have selected are already in use by another Contributor, you will see
the following error message.
8. If you see this error message, you have a few options. You can:
Select Yes to view the selected page options as Read-Only, i.e. view data, but not save any
inputs (the Save Data button will be disabled).
Select Noand return to the Choose menu to choose different page options.
Select No and close Excel to wait until the page options you want are available again.02/01/2026, 11:26 How-To: Using a File With Concurrent Contributor in the Tasks Tab – Vena Solutions

9. If you want to see which page options are currently in use, and by whom, return to the Task
Drawer in your browser and select the arrow section of the Input Data button.
10. This will open another section of the Task Drawer with more options. Here, select View Page
Options In Use in the Task Drawer.
11. After you have successfully chosen your page options, simply use the task form as normal.02/01/2026, 11:26 How-To: Using a File With Concurrent Contributor in the Tasks Tab – Vena Solutions

others to use the page options when you've finished your task by selecting Return File in the
Task Accordion or Drawer in the Vena Tasks or Contributor interface.
Using a Concurrent Contributor task form (Method Two)
Use these instructions if you know that the template you are using is a Hybrid template, or if the
Input Data button on the task form is a one-piece (not split) button with an arrow, like this:
To open a Concurrent Contributor task form (Hybrid templates):
1. Log in to Vena. If you are not taken there by default, select Tasks or Contributor to go to the
Task List.
2. In the Task List, next to the task form you would like to work on, on the right, select the
Input Data button without an arrow.

for Method One.

Alternatively, you can allow others to use the page options when you've completed your
tasks by selecting Return File in the Task Drawer in the Tasks tab.
Notes
Mac and Office Online users can also use page options on files enabled with Concurrent
Contributor:
If you are a Mac user, use the instructions from Method Two.
If you use Office Online, choose Method One or Method Two depending on the
appearance of the Input Data button.
Concurrent Contributor is designed primarily for continuous tasks that are never submitted.
Please be sure to follow your Vena Manager's instructions for submitting such tasks.
 Note
With this method, your page option selection is processed on the Vena web app,
rather than in Excel. As a result, the Choose button in the Excel Desktop will be
disabled.
If you would like to switch page options, close Excel and return the file, then select
new page options to use.02/01/2026, 11:26 How-To: Using a File With Concurrent Contributor in the Tasks Tab – Vena Solutions
