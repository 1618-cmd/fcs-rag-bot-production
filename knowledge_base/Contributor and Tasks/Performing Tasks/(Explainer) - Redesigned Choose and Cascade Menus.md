Function and SingleGetValueIn Vena Desktop, Choose and Cascade are key features that allow you to set different filters for
the data that is displayed ("page options"). To improve the experience of using these important
features, we have rethought the design of the Choose and Cascade interfaces to make them
even easier to use, especially for Vena novices.
The new Choose and Cascade menus still maintain all the same functionality as the old versions,
but in a modernized design that makes the workflow of selecting page options clearer and more
intuitive.
How it works
Once you have updated the Vena Excel Desktop to the latest version, the new Choose and
Cascade menus will be available to use immediately: simply click on the Choose or Cascade
buttons in the Vena ribbon to bring up the corresponding menu.
When opened, both menus present a clean, streamlined interface that offers drop-downs for
each configured page option. Click on a drop-down menu and a search box appears: just start
typing to narrow down the list of page options. Alternatively, you can also navigate manually to
the desired page option using the familiar hierarchy tree or switch to a simple list view.
Below is a brief demo of the new Choose menu, showing the dimension drop-down menus
first in hierarchy view and then in list view, with both filtered using the search box:02/01/2026, 11:32 Explainer: Redesigned Choose and Cascade Menus – Vena Solutions

The Cascade menu works the same way as the Choose menu, with the ability to multi-select the
page options that you want to cascade into individual worksheets.
In this demo, you can see the new Cascade menu, showing the dimension selection drop-
down and multi-selection of page options:02/01/2026, 11:32 Explainer: Redesigned Choose and Cascade Menus – Vena Solutions

What this means for you
To use the new Choose and Cascade functions, simply update to the latest version of Vena
Desktop for Excel. (You should receive a prompt within the Desktop when the update is available
to download.)
Getting used to the new interface should only take a few moments, as this revamp does not add
any major new functionality, and has been designed for greater simplicity.02/01/2026, 11:32 Explainer: Redesigned Choose and Cascade Menus – Vena Solutions

feedback!
