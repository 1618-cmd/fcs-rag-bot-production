Hide comments (Managers in Vena Desktop only)
On some templates, it can be helpful to remove the Comments feature to hide all comment
chains from the template's end users: for example, if previously commented intersections are
incorporated into a report and you do not want the end users of that report to be able to see the
comments. Managers can do this by removing the Comments feature from a template. This
setting works on a template-by-template basis, so the Comments feature will only be hidden on
the specific template(s) from which it was removed, while still remaining accessible on all others.
To remove Comments from a template:
1. Open the template/report on which you want to hide comments from end users and switch
to Manager view by selecting Edit Template.
