Suggested solution
1. Review your browser font settings and make sure that no italic font has been selected.
2. Try logging into Vena from a different browser or setting up a new Google Chrome profile.
3. Try using an incognito tab in Google to log into Vena. This rules out any browser extensions
causing the issue. 31/12/2025, 13:06 Troubleshooting: Vena Text Appears in Heavy Italic Font – Vena Solutions

4. Try restoring the default font settings in your PC/Laptop.
5. If none of the previoussteps worked, try resetting your PC with the help of your internal IT
team or have the team copy over font libraries from a computer where Vena is working as
expected. In some cases, creating a new Windows profile to login also helps resolve the
issue.
Cause
This happens when fonts in a computer have become corrupted or the computer does not have
the main or backup Vena fonts and replaces it with a heavy italic font. This issue is related to the
device, not Vena.
