Quickly grant access to your profile to the support team for troubleshooting
purposes and revoke it when support is complete.
Why use this feature?
While the Support team can troubleshoot most issues with the default Admin Account, we

Notes & Best Practices
If you do not see the option to grant access or you encounter an issue, ensure the ability for
users to grant access to Support is already enabled at the tenant level. Advise your Vena
Admin to visit this article to learn how to grant Vena Support access to your tenant for more
details.
Access is automatically revoked once the set time has expired.
If your Vena Admin disables this feature at the tenant level, all access will be revoked.31/12/2025, 12:22 How-To: Granting or Revoking Profile Access to the Vena Support Team – Vena Solutions
