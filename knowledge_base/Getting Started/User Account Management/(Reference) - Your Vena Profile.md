Grant Login Access to Vena Support*
If you run into an issue, you can use this feature to allow the Vena support team to gain access
to the application to see exactly what you're seeing. When you grant login access to Vena
support personnel, a Vena support employee who has also been granted access to the tenant
can log in as if they were the user (you). They will be able to perform any actions that can be
performed by the user they are logging in as.
You can refine the access permissions by using the drop-down menu to choose the duration you
want to grant access.31/12/2025, 12:08 Reference: Your Vena Profile – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026644391-Reference-Your-Vena-Profile 9/14

*The ability for individual users to grant login access to Vena support users is managed by your
Vena Admin. Read this article for more information about how an Admin can enable this
feature.
Note
When an Admin disables Vena support access at the tenant level, this will revoke
access authorization granted to Vena support by individual users.31/12/2025, 12:08 Reference: Your Vena Profile – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026644391-Reference-Your-Vena-Profile 10/14


Application Tokens
Vena's Application Tokens tab allows you to leverage your API User ID and create unique API
Keys for use in features like Power BI (visit this article for how to use PowerBI Connector).
For example, if a Contributor grants Vena support access to their tenant for 30 days
and an Admin disables Vena support user access at the tenant level, This cancels the
Vena support access that the Contributor initially granted. If an Admin re-enables
Vena support user access at the tenant level a day later, the grant made previously
by the Contributor user has already been canceled and is not in effect.31/12/2025, 12:08 Reference: Your Vena Profile – Vena Solutions
