How do I know which license types I have?
Your license combination may vary based on your Master Sales Agreement (MSA) or Term
Extensions (e.g., “Any Combination” Legacy Licenses or a combination of Power User, Business
User and View Only User). However, every tenant must have at least one Power User or Any
Combination license.
Higher-tier licenses can satisfy requirements for lower-tier roles (e.g., a Power User license can
be used for a Contributor or Viewer).
Navigate to Admin > Policies > General to view the new License Overview, which shows the
breakdown of licenses used, available by role and the usage rules. 31/12/2025, 12:13 Explainer: Role-Based Licensing Enforcement in Vena – Vena Solutions

How does Vena assign licenses to my users?
There's a difference between a user's required license and the license type they actually
consume. Depending on your license limits, a user may consume a higher license type than they
require. For example, a View Only user may consume a Contributor license.

What can I do if I reach or exceed license limits?
If you’re about to reach, have reached or have exceeded your license limits:
