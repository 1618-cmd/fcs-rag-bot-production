Superuser
Overview
The Superuser is a hybrid role that incorporates the responsibilities and permissions
of several roles under the "Superuser."
This is typically the first user role (and user group) created in a new Vena
environment. Once users are added to the Superuser group, those users can
perform actions like building data models, adding new users, populating reports, etc.
The responsibilities of a Superuser may vary between organizations, but generally,
these users are responsible for the tasks and functions mentioned in the table
below. 31/12/2025, 11:29 Explainer: Vena User Roles – Vena Solutions
