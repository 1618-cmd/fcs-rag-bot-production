Activity Block One step in a workflow process as defined by a Manager or Modeler in Vena Designer. An
Activity Block contains miniature workflows repeated across multiple business entities, and may
contain Input Blocks, Review Blocks, and Report Blocks with tasks for Contributors to complete.
Examples of activity groupings are "Data Collection" or "Head Office Budgeting".
Ad Hoc Analysis An impromptu breakdown of a business process, designed to answer a single, specific business
question or address certain scenarios. For example, an unexpected world event may require an
ad hoc analysis to determine how the event affects an organization's bottom line and provide
actionable next steps.

Block A set of rows and columns in a spreadsheet, mapped by a Modeler, which Vena uses to organize
information. The dimensions between each block can be pivoted from the row to the column or
vice versa. Blocks contain data values and do not include page filters (see also: Sections).
See an in-depth explanation of blocks versus sections here.
Block Form VariablesA dynamic way to add Form Variables that improves Excel performance and processing time.
Block Form Variables allows you to create a single Form Variable and apply this across multiple
rows or columns by updating the name range.
Blueprint A generic workflow structure defined by a user with the appropriate application permission.
These workflows contain the activity blocks in which Contributors and other users find their
tasks, and the basic structure may be copied and re-used across departments.
Bottom-level MembersThe lowest level of the data model hierarchy. Bottom-level members have no levels ('Children')
beneath them and do not include any other levels from the data model hierarchy. They contain
the information or data points from input cells, mapped using one category from each of the
three dimensions in a cube data model.
C

to run calculations and simulations for business rules at the database level for all dimensions
and members.
Calculated Member Special members that are composed of other members through an MQL statement. Calculated
members are most often used when a Modeler wants to create a special roll-up that is not
supported by the regular hierarchy.
Cascade A function allowing a user to open multiple data sets at the same time, with each set opening its
own page in a worksheet. Opening data sets from the Cascade function allows users to view31/12/2025, 11:33 Reference: Vena Glossary – Vena Solutions

them side-by-side for easier comparison.
Cell One unit of a worksheet, where data may be contained. One cell is defined by its location in a
row and column.
Central Template A template property (the most common type) that allows only Managers to make  structural
changes. Visit this article for further details on template properties.
Chart of Accounts A list of an organization's financial accounts.
Check-in The process of unlocking a file, task or template to mark it as available for access and/or editing.
Check-out The process of locking a file, task or template to mark it as unavailable for access and/or editing
by other users.
Child/Children The member or members of the data model hierarchy one level below a selected parent
member of the same hierarchy, but no levels below that.
Visit this article for more information on the data model hierarchy.
Clear Slice A function that selectively clears old data when loading fresh data. Clear slices focus solely on
intersections that weren't modified by the data load.

Dynamic Columns: Update across worksheets automatically in response to data model
changes.
Static Columns: Do not update if the data model changes.
Concurrent ContributorAn optional feature, enabled by a Manager, that allows multiple users to work on one task form
at the same time. Each user (Contributor) has access only to a specific set of page options at a
time.31/12/2025, 11:33 Reference: Vena Glossary – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030979471-Reference-Vena-Glossary 5/27

Connection/ConnectorA function allowing a user to retrieve data from an outside source for use in Vena. Two common
examples are QuickBooks Connector and Salesforce Connector.
Contributor A Vena user role focused on performing the tasks set by a Manager, such as inputting and
reviewing data. Depending on the task, Contributors may have different permissions:
Owner: Responsible for completing the task as defined by the Manager. Can input and edit
data in a template, as well as submit completed tasks.
Reviewer: Checks completeness of a task. May open and view a template, save data and
approve or reject tasks. They cannot submit completed tasks.
Support Worker: Provides help to the task Owner, if needed. May open templates and save
data or leave comments, but cannot formally review, submit or reject tasks.
Watcher: Keeps an eye on the task for any reason necessary. May only open a template for
viewing and leaving comments. Cannot save data, review, submit or reject tasks.
Visit this article for further details on this and other Vena user roles, including their permissions.
Contributor ConnectorA function in Vena 365 that allows a user to work on a task form (saving inputs, working with
Line-Item Details or using the Drill Functions) in Excel Online or Excel for Mac.
Cube Vena's data model, the backbone of our system; the three dimensions help simplify the
explanation for mapping out input. See also: Data Model
D
Data Model Also referred to as the "Cube", the data model is the backbone of the Vena system, hosting all
of an organization's financial information.31/12/2025, 11:33 Reference: Vena Glossary – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030979471-Reference-Vena-Glossary 6/27

Data Feed A mechanism used by the Integration tool when importing data into Vena from outside
sources. Data feeds tell the tool what data to retrieve and where to find it.
Data Permissions The specific cell data a user can access for input or review. These differ from application
permissions in that they are not based on user role; rather, an Admin must grant data
permissions to each user, depending on what part of the data model hierarchy the user needs
in order to complete their tasks.
Data Validation RulesUpper or lower limitations a Manager may set for any intersection in a template. The flexibility
around these rules depends on the data validation type:
Soft Validation Rule: An input outside the set limits will trigger a warning to the
Contributor that they've violated the rule, but still allows the input to be saved.
Hard Validation Rule: Contributors must adhere to the rule; any input outside the set
limits cannot be saved.
Default Member The member automatically populated into an Unmapped Dimension so a new template may
still be built (and no existing templates broken) even if a Dimension is unmapped.
Descendants All members of the data model hierarchy below a selected parent member of the same
hierarchy.
Visit this article or more information on the data model hierarchy.
Designer Vena's tool for creating automated workflows incorporating defined tasks and task owners, set
submission deadlines and monitor the review process. Designer workflows are specific to a
process.
Dimension A broad category of the data model containing members organized into a hierarchy. An
organization's dimensions depend on its internal structure and data, but common examples
include Department, Account and Period.31/12/2025, 11:33 Reference: Vena Glossary – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030979471-Reference-Vena-Glossary 7/27

Drill Functions Features that help users answer questions about specific data sets. Drill Functions include Drill
Save, Drill Transaction and Drill Down.
Drill Save A feature that allows users to view the detailed record of all changes made to a specific data
point (intersection) of the data model. These details may include the user who made the
change, the date and time the changes were made, which template the change was made in
and the save type.
Drill Transactions A feature that allows users to see how a value was arrived at by displaying the individual
transactions involved. This feature requires a Vena staging table setup that contains the
transactional data.
Dynamic Member SetSpecified groups of members defined by their position in the member hierarchy.
Dynamic Row MappingsA feature that automatically updates the rows of members in a hierarchy for all templates
whenever a new member is added to an organization's data model. When a row is dynamically
mapped, the Manager is saved from manually updating individual templates each time an
organization undergoes restructuring (such as a new account in a department).
E
ERP (Enterprise
Resource Planning)A type of software used by organizations to manage core business processes. ERP may be
integrated with Vena for easy transfer of data between applications.

ETL Job The execution of one ETL process. Jobs may relate to importing or exporting data, versioning
and validating data for template automation, etc.
Expression A search query that allows a user to filter out specific data subsets. Using either MQL or HQL,
the user can focus on particular intersections, LIDs, hierarchy members or attributes rather
than the entire dataset.
Expression Editor A tool in Vena where a user can write queries asking Vena to bring back a custom, dynamic set
of members from the data model.
Extract Step The step in an ETL job that captures a snapshot of a source's data.
Extract Table A table created by an Extract Step. Puts a snapshot of the output of an integration source into a
table within a staging area.
F
File in Use An icon shown beside a form on an Input or Review task when the file is in use by another user

dimensions. The MDR builder automatically updates these tables when changes are made to
dimensions, and can even hide rows containing no data.31/12/2025, 11:33 Reference: Vena Glossary – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030979471-Reference-Vena-Glossary 13/27

Member An element of the data model that describes the data in a given dimension. For example,
January, February and March are all members of the Month dimension.
Members are organized into levels as part of a hierarchy (see: Hierarchy).
Modal A window or pop-up that requires user action before moving on with a task.
Model Slice ExpressionA search query composed of one or more dimension expressions, where each dimension
expression defines a subset of that dimension's members.

N
No Edit Access An icon shown beside Review task forms where Allow Data Saves is not enabled.
Non-Excel File An icon shown beside any form and task when the form is not an Excel file.
Non-specific Members "Not <dimension> Specific" refers to members of a data model that are not tied to the other
members in a given dimension. This type of member can be mapped when a template doesn't
use this dimension as part of their data.
For example, if the Product dimension is not relevant to the "Personnel expenses" file, then you
can map the Product dimension to the "Non Product specific" member, as it is a requirement
that every dimension inside a template is mapped.
Non-specific member examples:
Not Account Specific
Not Entity Specific
Not Department Specific
Not Year Specific
Not Period Specific
Not Currency Specific
Not Scenario Specific
O
OLAP (Online
Analytical Processing)A model that allows users to analyze information from multiple database systems at the same
time. It is a technology that enables users to extract and view business data from different points
of view.31/12/2025, 11:33 Reference: Vena Glossary – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030979471-Reference-Vena-Glossary 15/27

OLAP: Dimensions,
Hierarchy, Member,
Roll-upAll allow a robust way to view and analyze data; ex. Seeing the total cost of sales for each quarter
for a specific department. The cost of sales, quarter and department are all dimensions in the
OLAP structure. Within each dimension, there can exist a hierarchy consisting of members. Ex.
Gross Profit is a roll-up member of the accounts dimension which contains 2 members: Total
Revenue and Cost of Goods Sold. The power of the OLAP cube is being able to analyze the
intersections of various roll-up members.
OLAP Cube The multi-dimensional database is used for storing data for reporting purposes. Data is
categorized by dimensions and pre-summarized to improve query time. Unlike a traditional DB,
OLAP is designed using business logic and used by business users using plain English. For
example, OLAP cube for reporting sales might have dimensions: Salesperson, Sales Amount,
Region, Product, Date.
Operand & OperatorIn Vena Calcs, expressions consist of two types of components:operandsand
operators. Operands are the objects that are manipulated and operatorsare the symbols that
represent specific actions.
For example, in the expression:
5 +x
x and 5 are operands and + is an operator. All expressions have at least one operand.
Owner A task-specific user role for the Contributor responsible for entering data into and submitting an
input task. An Owner may also be responsible for reviewing tasks.
P
Pages A filter that narrows down broad dimension members that don't fit into rows and columns. For
example, 'Year' may be a Page, and 2017 the Page Option (see below).
Page Options Mappings in a template that contain multiple members from the same dimension. With Page
Options, users may pre-select filers using the Choose box when opening a template.31/12/2025, 11:33 Reference: Vena Glossary – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030979471-Reference-Vena-Glossary 16/27

Parent Member The member of a data model hierarchy above any selected child (or children) member.
Placeholder DimensionEditable categories for organizations to include dimensions in their data models that may be
unique to their chart of accounts or General Ledger string.
Process A step in a workflow for a business operation. The term "process" can encompass tasks,
deadlines, reviews and the user(s) responsible for it.
Process Filter A function for users to isolate tasks assigned to them by various states of completion.
Process Variable A particular member in a central location that can be mapped and referenced in any template
or report. This function allows a Manager to make one change that applies to all templates and
reports using that member.
Prompt A tailored query to Vena Copilot that provides additional context to improve accuracy for
specific questions. Prompts are added to your organization’s question bank in Vena Copilot,
where future user queries can be matched to them for an accurate response.
Q
Query A request for specific data from the cube that can be made from different available set
languages such as MQL, HQL, and Staging Queries.
Question Category A selection feature to help Vena Copilot use Prompts in a more systematic way. Setting a
category improves how effectively the Prompt can be matched to semantically similar questions
in the future. This also helps users track the themes for past Prompts on the Rule Management
page.31/12/2025, 11:33 Reference: Vena Glossary – Vena Solutions

https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030979471-Reference-Vena-Glossary 19/27

Scope A feature that limits the AI model to seeing only a portion of the hierarchy that is present in
the data model. Scopes are helpful to prevent matching incorrect members and double-
counting figures.
Sections The area of a template where pages (filters) are applied. Sections create a boundary or
"fence" around the blocks of data, which provides context to the data seen in the table and
may consist of one block or several blocks. All blocks within a section contain the same
number of dimensions (see also: Blocks).
Shared Member A feature allowing Managers to create alternative hierarchies within a dimension by
enabling the aggregating reporting of collected data.
For example, within the Period dimension, month members can be shared to allow
aggregation of quarter-to-date and year-to-date values.
Sibling Two or more child members under the same parent member.
Visit this article for further information on the data model hierarchy, including siblings.
Soft Validation An upper or lower limit set by a Manager on an input cell that triggers a warning if a
Contributor enters a value beyond these limits. The warnings inform the Contributor
they've gone beyond the limit, but the data may still be saved. Contributors may enter
notes with their reasoning for Managers to view.
Spreadsheet One or more worksheets containing a cell grid arranged in rows and columns. Used for
organizing, analyzing and storing data.
SQL (Structured Query
Language)A programming language used to transform data in a Staging Table.
SSS (Server Side
Suppression)A function for identifying rows with missing data and removing them before data is sent to
a user's computer. Removing these rows first means the potential thousands of blank rows
aren't rendered by Excel, which could result in excessive load times and poor usability.31/12/2025, 11:33 Reference: Vena Glossary – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030979471-Reference-Vena-Glossary 20/27

Staging Area Home for Staging Tables. There are two kinds of Staging Areas: per-job Staging Areas are
created at the start of an ETL job and deleted at the end and user Staging Areas are for
users doing development and troubleshooting of queries.
Staging Query Allows a user to retrieve data from any table created from the ETL import process and
apply it directly to their template.
Staging Table An environment where data can be transformed via SQL commands to the required format
or where multiple sources can be consolidated before being loaded into the cube.
Standalone Template

departments. Standard Dimensions may be renamed if needed.
Standard Members Common members available to add to a dimension, which may be renamed depending on
