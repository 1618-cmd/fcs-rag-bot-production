Product UpdatesThat said, some areas of the product are still being improved. We’re working toward full
accessibility across the entire Vena experience, starting with the features used most often. Our
goal is to ensure that everyone can use Vena with ease and confidence.
Which parts of Vena are accessible?
The Contributor/Tasks section of the Vena web application is fully accessible and optimized for
accessibility. We have prioritized this section initially as it is the most widely used part of the
Vena web application, with the other parts (e.g. Manager, Modeler, etc.) to follow. In addition,
the main login page is, of course, also designed to be accessible.
Vena Desktop is partially accessible, with an emphasis on the most frequently used parts.
Almost all of the Contributor menu (Edit Data) in Desktop is accessible, including primary
interface elements such as the title bar and toolbar buttons, as well as more specific
elements such as the Choose menu, pop-ups, and other message boxes.
The Manager menu (Edit Template) is not accessible to the same degree. In addition to
accessibility optimizations specific to Vena Desktop, Excel also offers accessibility features.

Does Vena follow any specific accessibility guidelines?
All of our accessibility features are designed to comply with the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). These help us to
ensure that Vena's accessibility features provide a consistent experience for users with
disabilities.31/12/2025, 11:34 Explainer: Is Vena Accessible For People With Disabilities? – Vena Solutions

What exactly does "accessible" mean in Vena?
When we state that Vena is "accessible," we mean it’s designed to meet widely recognized
accessibility standards, such as the WCAG 2.0 guidelines. These standards help ensure all users
can perceive, navigate and interact with web content effectively.
We build Vena to support people who use assistive technologies, such as screen readers, or who
rely primarily on keyboard navigation due to mobility or dexterity needs.
Our goal is to proactively identify and remove barriers, making Vena easier and more productive
to use.
Are Vena's accessibility features optimized for any
particular software?
Because of its popularity and widespread use, we have specifically designed our accessibility
features with the JAWS screen reader in mind. Other screen reader software should also work
in many cases, though we primarily test our accessibility features with JAWS.
To complement this, we also recommend using theGoogle Chromebrowser, as we have found
it to work best with our website when using JAWS.
Does Vena use any special keyboard shortcuts for
navigation?
Vena supports the standard keyboard shortcuts Taband Shift+Tabto cycle forward and
backward between elements, including page elements in the web application and interface
elements in Excel.31/12/2025, 11:34 Explainer: Is Vena Accessible For People With Disabilities? – Vena Solutions

Is any setup required to use the accessibility features?
Most of Vena's accessibility features are built into the product by default, ensuring that features
like keyboard navigation and screen reader descriptions work smoothly without any special
setup required.
The only place where some setup is required to enable accessibility features is within Vena
Desktop: here, Accessibility Mode is used to turn on accessibility optimizations. It can be
enabled in either of two ways:
For individual users
This method turns on Accessibility Mode for a single user's device only. It's most useful if you
have a mixture of users with and without disabilities among your user base, and want to enable
accessibility features in Desktop only for specific users.
To enable Accessibility Mode in Desktop for yourself only (or for a single user):
1. Open any Vena template and select the Settings button.
2. In the Settings window, select the Advancedtab.
3. Find the AccessibilityMode setting and change its value from False to True to enable
Accessibility Mode.
4. Select OK to close the Settings window.31/12/2025, 11:34 Explainer: Is Vena Accessible For People With Disabilities? – Vena Solutions
