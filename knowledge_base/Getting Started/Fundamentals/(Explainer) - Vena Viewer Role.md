Introducing the Vena Viewer role, a streamlined view-only role that lets you grant
specific users access to view data without the need for complex setups.

Viewer overview
With the new Vena Viewer role, we've simplified the onboarding experience for view-only users.
With a few clicks, you can add users in a secure, view-only role without having to manage user
group application permissions. The Viewer role allows you to add users in a view-only capacity to
see assigned templates and reports, add comments, and collaborate with users.

Viewer role specifics
Adding a user as a Viewer
When adding a user in the Viewer role, the onboarding process is the same as adding any other
type of user to your Vena platform. Since the Viewer role functions as a standalone role, you
cannot combine the role with other roles in Vena. If you select Viewer as your desired role for a
particular user, the Vena platform will automatically disable the options for other role types.
Check out this article to learn more about the Vena onboarding process.
If you want to add multiple users at once, you can use Vena's bulk user import/export to speed
up this process. By allowing you to import a pre-formatted list of users, you can save time when31/12/2025, 11:31 Explainer: Vena Viewer Role – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/4420108205581-Explainer-Vena-Viewer-Role 3/10

working with multiple users. Vena's user import/export allows you to import any type of user,
including users in the Viewer role.
Check out this article to learn more about the bulk user import/export feature.
Viewer permissions
When assigning users to user groups, users in the Viewer role will automatically be granted
"Read" permissions for any Application Permissions you give to the group as a whole. This
setting overrides any other manual permissions assigned to the group. So if, for example, user
group A has been given "Create" permissions for data models, the Viewer roles in that user
group will still only have "Read" access.
You can apply Data Permissions, which allow you to control access to cell data in templates and
reports at a granular level, as needed to give your Viewers access to relevant data in select
templates and reports.
Check out this article to learn more about Application Permissions.

Viewer template and report access
When Viewers sign into Vena, they will land on the Viewer tab. This tab, similar in appearance to
the Contributor or Tasks tab, provides access to all template and report tasks assigned to that
user. Viewers can review tasks by selecting a task, then selecting the View button.
Once the template opens, Viewers can analyze data via the Drill Down, Drill Save and Drill
Transactions tools. If comments are available on the sheet, Viewers may add or respond to
comments.

Viewers and task assignment
When adding Viewers to specific tasks in a process workflow, Managers can only add Viewers in
the Watcher task role.
If a Manager attempts to add a user group containing Viewers to the Owner or Support Worker
task role, an error message will appear. Managers may select the (?) icon to view a list containing
the names of users excluded from the Owner/Support Worker task role.31/12/2025, 11:31 Explainer: Vena Viewer Role – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/4420108205581-Explainer-Vena-Viewer-Role 6/10

Similarly, if a Manager attempts to add an individual user in the Viewer role (e.g., not an entire
user group) as an Owner or Support Worker, that user name will not show up in the list of
available users.31/12/2025, 11:31 Explainer: Vena Viewer Role – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/4420108205581-Explainer-Vena-Viewer-Role 7/10

If a Manager wants the omitted users to be part of the task, they will need to add the users
individually to the Watcher task role.
Check out this article to learn more about assigning users to tasks as part of a process workflow.
Migrating existing users to a Viewer role
If you already have custom-built read-only roles in your Vena environment, you will need to
purchase Viewer licenses if you want to move users over to the Viewer role.
If you decide to change a custom-built read-only role over to a Viewer role, it is important to
consider the following:
If a user is assigned as an individual (e.g., not part of a user group) to tasks in an active
process as an Owner and/or Support Worker, these users will need to be removed from the31/12/2025, 11:31 Explainer: Vena Viewer Role – Vena Solutions

Owner/Support Worker role prior to their user role being changed over to Viewer.
If a user is not assigned to any tasks in an active process (a process is considered active when
it is "In Play"), then their user role type may be updated without requiring further action.
