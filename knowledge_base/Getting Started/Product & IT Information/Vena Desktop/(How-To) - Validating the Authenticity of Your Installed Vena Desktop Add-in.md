3. Confirm the Publisher
When you see prompts such as “Unknown publisher,” verify that the publisher’s name refers to
Vena as shown in the image below before selecting Run or Install. 31/12/2025, 12:32 How-To: Validating the Authenticity of Your Installed Vena Desktop Add-in – Vena Solutions

4. Understanding Windows Defender Warnings
Because new certificates take time to be widely recognized by Windows, you might see a pop-up
warning from Windows Defender.
Running a reliable anti-virus scan can provide extra confirmation that the installer is safe.
5. Understanding Certificate Expiry
Over time, software certificates expire, and this can cause warnings or limitations within some
organization’s security policies.
We always recommend updating to the latest version of Vena Desktop, which is signed with our
newest certificate. 31/12/2025, 12:32 How-To: Validating the Authenticity of Your Installed Vena Desktop Add-in – Vena Solutions

6. Contact Vena Support for Assurance
If something seems off, such as persistent warnings, unusual file properties or mismatched
publisher information, pause the installation/update and contact Vena Support. We can confirm
you have the correct version.
By following these steps, you can be confident that you’re either installing or continuing to use
the authentic version of our Vena Desktop.
