Requires Higher Version of .NETStep 1: Add additional domains as trusted sites
Most organizations have security checks in place in order to install an application. The most
common security check involves adding domains to your trusted sites. Sometimes, organizations
give users the ability to perform this task themselves.
If you are unable to install the application, try adding the following domains to your trusted sites
by using the steps in this article:
https://*.vena.io
http://addin.vena.io
venamonitor.exe
Step 2: MalwareBytes error
MalwareBytes is virus protection software used by some of our organizations. It performs
additional security checks on top of what Windows already offers. If you see a MalwareBytes

2. Select Settings and then select Exclusions.
