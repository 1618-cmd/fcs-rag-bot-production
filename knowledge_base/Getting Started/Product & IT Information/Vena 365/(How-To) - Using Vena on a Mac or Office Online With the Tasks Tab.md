How to
The Vena web application (vena.io), will generally work the same way regardless of which operating system you are using. In
this article, we will focus exclusively on the procedures that are specific to Mac use.

Link your Office 365 account with Vena
Provided you have an active subscription to Office 365 (either a personal or a business subscription), all you have to do to
use Office Online to work on your Vena files is link your Microsoft account to your Vena account.
Connecting your Microsoft account with Vena involves authorizing Vena to access your OneDrive, which is a Microsoft cloud
storage service (similar to Dropbox or Google Drive) that is included with your Office 365 subscription. This is necessary
because Vena uses OneDrive to temporarily store files so that they can be opened in Excel Online.
 Microsoft account authorization and permissions
When you link your Microsoft account with Vena, Microsoft creates an authorization token for this purpose, so
your Microsoft account credentials are never shared with Vena. This also means that if you need to change your
Microsoft account password, the Vena authorization is unaffected and remains in place.31/12/2025, 12:59 How-To: Using Vena on a Mac or Office Online With the Tasks Tab – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/18583489888525-How-To-Using-Vena-on-a-Mac-or-Office-Online-With-the-Tasks-Tab 4/26

Connect your Microsoft account with Vena
You only need to connect your Microsoft account and create an authorization once. After you have set up the authorization,
it will be saved and your Microsoft account will remain connected to your Vena account until you remove it.
To connect your Microsoft account with Vena:
1. Log in to Vena and select Tasks then open a file (see below for instructions).
2. The first time you open a file, instead of seeing an option for Excel Online, you will instead see a Connect with OneDrive
button.
3. Select Connect with OneDrive. You will be redirected to the Microsoft login page. Here, enter the email address for the
Microsoft account on which you have an Office 365 subscription and select Next.
However, be aware that the process of linking your Microsoft account with Vena also requires giving Vena
permission to access your Microsoft OneDrive storage for the linked account. This is necessary for Vena files to
work with Office Online, but the authorization also extends to any other files in your OneDrive storage.
Vena will only access Vena-created files in your OneDrive account (i.e., those that you open from the Vena web
application). If you also use your OneDrive storage for other files, you may wish to consider whether granting the
necessary authorization is appropriate for your security policies. If necessary, you may opt to use an alternative
Microsoft account to link with Vena, or a shared account with other users (as multiple Vena accounts can be
linked with the same Microsoft account).31/12/2025, 12:59 How-To: Using Vena on a Mac or Office Online With the Tasks Tab – Vena Solutions

4. If you have more than one Microsoft account associated with this email address, you may see a screen asking you to
choose which account you want to use e.g., a work/school account or a personal account. Select the appropriate account31/12/2025, 12:59 How-To: Using Vena on a Mac or Office Online With the Tasks Tab – Vena Solutions

type (typically, this will be a work account).
5. Type in your password for this account, then select Sign In.
6. You should see a page which asks you to authorize giving Vena access to your Microsoft account. Read through to
understand what permissions you are authorizing, then select Yesto proceed.31/12/2025, 12:59 How-To: Using Vena on a Mac or Office Online With the Tasks Tab – Vena Solutions

7. You will now be automatically returned to Vena, where the Connect with OneDrive button is replaced with an Excel Online
button. 31/12/2025, 12:59 How-To: Using Vena on a Mac or Office Online With the Tasks Tab – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/18583489888525-How-To-Using-Vena-on-a-Mac-or-Office-Online-With-the-Tasks-Tab 8/26

8. You can now start using files with Excel Online.
Disconnect your Microsoft account from Vena
If you want to use a different Microsoft account with Vena, or simply disconnect it altogether, you can do so at any time. You
will not be able to use Office Online with Vena if there is no Microsoft account linked to your Vena account.
To disconnect your Microsoft account from Vena:
1. Select your name in the top right corner of Vena.
2. Navigate to the Microsoft Account tab and select Unlink Account.
 Note
After you link your Microsoft and Vena accounts, opening a file for the first time will create a new APPS folder in
your OneDrive. This is where any files that you download from Vena for use in Excel Online are temporarily
stored (files will be deleted from this folder again upon return).
If you use your OneDrive outside of Vena, please do not use this APPS folder for storing your own files, as any
files placed in this folder may be automatically deleted by Vena.31/12/2025, 12:59 How-To: Using Vena on a Mac or Office Online With the Tasks Tab – Vena Solutions

3. If you want, you can immediately link another Microsoft account by selecting the Link Account button, otherwise select
Close to return to Vena.
4. If you no longer plan to use the removed account with Vena in the future, you should also separately remove the
authorization in your Microsoft account. Visit this Microsoft page and sign in to the Microsoft account you removed.
5. After signing in, navigate to Vena Cloud and select Edit.31/12/2025, 12:59 How-To: Using Vena on a Mac or Office Online With the Tasks Tab – Vena Solutions

6. Select Remove these permissions.
7. If you connect this account with Vena again in the future, you will be prompted to create the authorization again.
Open and download files
If you are using a Mac, Vena will detect this and switch to "Mac Mode" automatically. This means that instead of prompting
you to download a file traditionally, it will present you with additional options that either allow you to download a Mac-
optimized version of the file or open the file in Excel Online.
You can also open files with Excel Online if you are using Windows, and the process is largely similar.
To open and download a file:31/12/2025, 12:59 How-To: Using Vena on a Mac or Office Online With the Tasks Tab – Vena Solutions

1. Log in to Vena and select Tasks to view your Task List.
2. Select the task you want to work on to open the task accordion.
3. In the task accordion, you will see the task forms listed under the Task Forms section. Next to each task form, you should
see either a View, Input Data or Review Data button, depending on the type of task form. These buttons will be either one-
piece or split, depending on your operating system.

Note: If you see Connect with OneDrive instead of Excel Online, you must first connect your Microsoft account with Vena.
See this section for instructions.
7. Select an option to open your file.
If you choose Download or PDF, the file will start downloading and the Task Drawer will change to show that the file is
in use.
If you choose Excel Online, the task will change to show that the file is in use and you will see an Edit button. Select this
button to open the file in Office Online in a new browser window.
On View-Only files, choosing Excel Online (View Only) will open the file in Office Online when you select the button.
8. Your file is now in use and will open in your chosen version of Excel where you can start working on it.
Using the Vena Contributor Connector
Once you have downloaded or opened a task form, the Vena Contributor Connector is what allows you to work on the form:
saving inputs, working with Line-Item Details or using Drill functions.
To use the Contributor Connector:
1. When you download a task form and open it in Excel (either the Mac version or Excel Online), the Contributor Connector
is installed automatically. The first time that you open a file with the Contributor Connector, you will see a prompt asking
you if you want to start the Contributor Connector.31/12/2025, 12:59 How-To: Using Vena on a Mac or Office Online With the Tasks Tab – Vena Solutions

2. Select Start to load the Contributor Connector.
3. You can now begin using the functions in the Contributor Connector to work with your task form. See this section below
for details on how to use the various features.

Line-Items.
To add Line-Item Details:
1. Select a cell in a row where you would like to add a Line-Item Detail.
2. Select Insert LID in the Contributor Connector menu to add a Line-Item to that row.

You can learn more about what the Drill functions do, as well as how to use them, in this article.
Returning files
Unlike Vena Desktop, the Contributor Connector can't automatically return a task form when you exit, so this requires an
additional step.
To return a file after use:
1. Log in to Vena and select Tasks to view your Task List.
2. Select the task you were working on to open the Task Drawer.
3. Under the Forms section, select Return File and a new section of the Task Drawer opens.
4. To complete the return, select Return File in the prompt if you're sure you have no unsaved changes.
Notes & Known Limitations
Excel Online does not support Vena 365.
Excel Online only supports standard Excel files (XLSX) and is not compatible with macro-enabled Excel files (XLSM). While
you can still view reports in XLSM format in Excel Online, a message is shown to warn you that the file may not function
as intended when viewed in Excel Online. Input templates in XLSM format can not be opened with Excel Online at this
time.31/12/2025, 12:59 How-To: Using Vena on a Mac or Office Online With the Tasks Tab – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/18583489888525-How-To-Using-Vena-on-a-Mac-or-Office-Online-With-the-Tasks-Tab 24/26

Excel Online does not support Soft Validations. If a task form has been set up with validation rules (i.e., inputs must meet
certain requirements) and the validation type has been set to 'soft' (displays a warning that validation failed, but permits
saving data), opening the task form in Excel Online will treat the validation type as 'hard' instead (prevents saving data if
validation fails).
You will only need to sign in to Office 365 once in a given session. If you close one task form after signing in and
subsequently open another one in the same session, you will remain signed in and can immediately use the Vena
Contributor Connector.
If you link a shared Microsoft account to Vena (i.e., multiple Vena accounts all link to the same Microsoft account), keep in
mind that files opened from Vena by any of these users will appear in the Vena-created APPS folder in OneDrive, and can
therefore be accessed by any other user with access to the OneDrive account (including files that they would not have
access to through Vena).
The Contributor experience for Mac users does not currently support templates with multiple data models.
