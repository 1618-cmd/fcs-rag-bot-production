Learn about Microsoft's Central Deployment feature and what it means for your Vena
experience.
What is it?
Central Deployment is a Microsoft feature that lets IT administrators install and manage Office
Add-ins for users, so the IT team can deploy tools directly to specific users or groups.

ManagerDepending on how your IT environment is configured, some organizations use Central
Deployment to control which add-ins are available, while others allow users to freely download
add-ins from the Office Store.
Learn more in Microsoft's Central Deployment FAQ article.
How do I check if I require central deployment?
Confirm how add-ins are managed by checking with your organization’s IT team. You can also
open the Office Add-ins Store and try installing an add-in to test how it works.
Alternatively, you can try accessing the Vena Ad Hoc tool, which functions in the same way. If you
can’t install an add-in, or an informational message appears (as in the image after this
paragraph), it likely means your IT environment restricts individual access to the Office Store. In
that case, pre-approved add-ins are usually managed and deployed centrally by your IT team.

If restrictions are in place, you may see an add-in error when trying to access our add-ins. In that
case, your IT team must use our manifest file to centrally deploy the add-in to specific users or

How does this impact Vena Desktop?
Vena Desktop users are not impacted, as Central Deployment applies only to Microsoft Office
Web Add-ins (including JavaScript-based add-ins) that are managed through the Microsoft 365
Admin Center.
Vena Desktop operates as a COM add-in, which is an older format that must be downloaded and
installed locally on each user's computer. These add-ins work directly with Microsoft Office via
the Windows operating system and must be set up either manually or through other IT-
managed deployment tools. Unlike Office Web Add-ins, COM add-ins are not integrated with the
Microsoft 365 admin center, so they cannot be centrally deployed or managed in the same way.
