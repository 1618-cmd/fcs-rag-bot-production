General Troubleshooting
ManagerSandbox gives you first-hand access to building a flexible, holistic planning approach that
supports true development progression, review and refinement before going live into your
production environment.
Before you begin
You will need a Sandbox environment to follow the steps in this article.
If you are interested in learning more about this feature, reach out to your Account Manager for
details.
How to
Log In to the Sandbox Environment
1. Ensure you are accessing Vena via https://vena.io/, unless Single Sign-On (SSO) is enabled for
your Sandbox environment.
2. Enter your Account ID in the email address field. Your Account ID will have this format:
<username>@<originaldomain>sandbox.com
Example:
Production Account: vena.user@vena.com
Sandbox Account: vena.user@venasandbox.com
3. Enter your password. The same password as your production tenant account will work. If it
doesn't work, please refer to the next section.31/12/2025, 13:01 How-To: Accessing Your Sandbox Environment – Vena Solutions

Product UpdatesReset Your Sandbox Account Password
Since the Account ID for your Sandbox environment is not an actual email address, we will use
the Contact Email Address field to receive the email for the Sandbox environment.
1. Visit this article for how to reset or change your password, but ensure you are entering your
Sandbox Account ID (<username>@<originaldomain>sandbox.com.
2. The reset password link will be sent to your contact email address. Although the password
reset link will be sent to your actual email address, the password will be reset for your
Sandbox Account ID.
What if my Production Tenant Uses SSO and I do not know my password?
It is common for users with SSO in their Production environment to not have a password set in
Production. In this case, you will reset your Sandbox tenant account by following the steps
here. This will allow you to create a password for your account in your Sandbox environment.
