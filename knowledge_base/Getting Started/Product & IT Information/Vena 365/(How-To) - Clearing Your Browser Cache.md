Windows or Installing VenaHow-To: Clearing Your Browser Cache
If you're experiencing problems with the Vena web interface, such as missing
elements, unresponsive pages or failed downloads, clearing your browser cache is a
quick and effective first step.
Why use this feature?
Web browsers store site files (like layout and images) in a cache to load pages faster. Sometimes,
outdated or broken cached files can cause display or functionality issues. Clearing the cache
forces the browser to reload fresh files, often resolving the problem immediately.
