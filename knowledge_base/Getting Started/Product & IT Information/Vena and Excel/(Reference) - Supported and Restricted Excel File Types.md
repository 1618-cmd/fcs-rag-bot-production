What do I do if I have already uploaded an unsupported file tpe (.xls)?
If you have already uploaded .xls files and associated tasks to them, you can avoid re-assigning
these templates to their tasks by following the below steps to re-save and upload them as one of
the supported file types:
1. Open the respective .xls template from your Files Library and save it locally as one of the
above supported file types (must be from Excel 2007 or newer).
2. Go back to your Vena Files Library, select the .xls template and select Replace.
3. Select Yes to the replace item disclaimer, choose the file you saved locally, and select OK to
save the changes.
