# How To  Building a Custom Roll up Using Calculated Members – Vena Solutions

How-To: Building a Custom Roll-up
Using Calculated Members
Create custom roll-ups using  Calculat ed Member s for more efficient report creation.

Why use this featur e?
In Vena, can create special members that are comprised of other members--called  Calculat ed
Member s.
Calculated Members are most often used to create a special roll-up that is not supported by the
regular hierarchy. This roll-up can then be used as a custom reporting bucket, representing a useful
shortcut when building reports.
In this article, you will learn about situations in which Calculated Members can be used, as well as
how to create them.

Befor e you begin
In order to complete the steps outlined on this page, you need at least  Modeler  access.
Additionally, to map Calculated Members on templates and reports, you need  Manager  access and
the relevant Data P ermissions for the Calculated Members (if Data P ermissions are set up in your
environment).

Use case examples
The following examples illustrate when using a Calculated Member would be recommended. T o go

Imagine that your company operates a number of stores nationwide. In your hierarchy, the stores
are placed under parent members representing the city in which they are located (e.g., Chicago,
New Y ork, etc.), and are tagged with attributes based on the type of product they carry (e.g.,
Widget A, Widget B, etc.).
Given this hierarchy, if you were creating a report and wanted to get a number representing just the
stores carrying Widget A, it would not be possible to use a roll-up. Since the hierarchy is organized
geographically, it will give you a roll-up for all the stores in, say, Chicago, but not for all the stores
that carry Widget A (regardless of location). Instead, you would need to find a different approach.

Example 2
Consider a standard hierarchy in which all of your expense accounts are grouped under a parent
member named  Total Expens es. If you build a report and map the  Total Expens es roll-up, the report
will display a figure that includes all of the expense accounts listed under the  Total Expens es parent.
But what if you wanted to exclude an account?
For example, in some instances, it might be useful to see a figure representing all of your expenses,
but without depreciation included. In this case, the  Total Expens es roll-up will not work, as it will
include the  Depr eciation  account. Y ou would need to find some other way of getting total expenses
with depreciation excluded.

Solutions: Alt ernate Hierar chies vs. Calculat ed Member s
Creating alternate hierarchies with shared members  can solve the problem of rolling up specific
members, such as all stores with Widget A or all expense accounts except depreciation. However,
this method can clutter your hierarchy.
A better solution is to use a Calculated Member. By writing a simple expression, you can create a
synthetic parent member for a subset of members (e.g., "all stores with Widget A" or "all expense
accounts except depreciation"). This allows you to use the Calculated Member in reports for roll-
ups.
Some other benefits of using Calculated Members instead of alternate hierarchies:
Parent members cannot be shared, but Calculated Members can include both parent and
bottom level members.
Unlike alternate hierarchies, Calculated Members can be defined both statically and dynamically.

How to
Setting up a Calculated Member is a two-step process:
1. Create the Calculated Member in the data model.
2. Define the members to be rolled up.26/12/2025, 14:25 How-To: Building a Custom Roll-up Using Calculated Members – Vena Solutions

Create & Configur e a Calculat ed Member
Calculated Members are created in the Modeler, similar to the way standard members are created.

To create a Calculat ed Member :
1. Navigate to the  Modeler  tab.
2. Select  Data Modeler , then Member s in the sidebar.
3. Choose the data model you want to modify using the drop-down menu.
4. Select the  dimension  under which you want to create the Calculated Member.
5. Right-click on a member that is on the same level as where you want to create the Calculated
Member.
6. Select  Add Calculat ed Member  from the menu that appears.
  Note
When choosing where to create a Calculated Member, remember it will be included
in the roll-up to its parent member. For more information about the placement of
Calculated Members within your hierarchy, review the  Notes & Best
Practices  section at the end of this article.26/12/2025, 14:25 How-To: Building a Custom Roll-up Using Calculated Members – Vena Solutions

Add Calculat ed Member  functions essentially the same way as  Add Sibling  in that the new
member is created alongside the member that you right-clicked on, not above (parent) or
below (child).
7. In the text box that appears, type in a name for the Calculated Member.
8. If desired, you can also specify an Alias, add an attribute or select an operator for the Calculated
Member. If you want to skip this, leave the text box blank.
9. If you are ready to configure your Calculated Member, proceed to step 11. If you want to
configure your Calculated Member at a later time, select  Save.
10. Once you have created a Calculated Member, you need to specify which members it will
comprise. Y ou do this by writing an expression, a short instruction that defines the members and
(optionally) attributes that you want to include or exclude.
11. Select  Σ Edit Expr ession .
12. The Editing Calculat ed member  window will appear with the name of the Calculated Member
listed at the top. In the text field provided, type in your expression using Model Slice Query26/12/2025, 14:25 How-To: Building a Custom Roll-up Using Calculated Members – Vena Solutions

Language (MQL):
Expressions are constructed using MQL syntax.
Please use this reference guide for comprehensive help with writing MQL expressions.
13. When you have entered your expression, select  Save.
14. The Calculated Member is now ready to be used.
15. You can always edit a Calculated Member by right-clicking on it and selecting  Edit.

Notes & best practices
Calculated Members must be located at the bottom-level of the hierarchy. They cannot be
parent members or have child members.
When you right-click on a member which has been configured with an expression, the
option  Validat e Calculat ed Member s is available. Note that selecting this option only performs
cycle detection on the expression and cannot determine if the expression is otherwise valid (i.e.,
whether it will work in an intended way).
Because intersections formed with Calculated Members are not "true" intersections, the  Preview
intersections  function found in the Data Modeler does not work for Calculated Members.
We recommend creating Calculated Members at the root level of a dimension or under a
designated parent. This ensures accurate roll-ups, as including Calculated Member under a
parent in the hierarchy and then mapping that parent on a report will cause incorrect figures.
Alternatively, if you do wish to place a Calculated Member among your hierarchy, you can
prevent it from being included in roll-ups to its parent member by setting the  Oper ator for the
Calculated Member to '~' (i.e. "do not include in roll-up").
