In the example above, let's say you want to create a rollup of Operation Divisions excluding Division
D. To go about this, the expression will be:
SUBTRACT(CHILDREN(' Oper ating Divisions '),'Division D' )
If you want to exclude Dept 401, which is a bottom level child of Division D, then the expression will
be:
SUBTRACT(BO TTOMLEVEL(' Oper ating Divisions '),'Dept 401' )
