Explainer: What Are Unmapped
Dimensions and Default Members?
Not sure what an  Unmapped Dimension  or a Default Member  is, or how to use them?
Read on to learn more.

What is the Default Member?
While using the Data Modeler, you might have noticed a member —probably named  Default
member —with an
  icon next to it. Y ou've may have seen the same icon appear next to a  Pin as
Default Member  option in the menu that appears when you right-click on any member:

The
  icon indicates that this member is the current Default Member for this dimension.  Pin as
Default Member  gives you the option of changing that designation to any other member. But what
does this mean? T o understand what the Default Member is, we first have to look at the Unmapped
Dimension feature, and the mechanics of mapping a V ena template.
 The "Default Member" vs.  The "Default member" member
In the screenshot below , there is a member named  "Default member" , and it also  is the
Default Member for its dimension. They're  not the same thing, so don't  confuse them!
A member named "Default member" is created whenever you set up a new dimension.
While it is also automatically the Default Member for a newly created dimension, they
are not always one and the same. Because you can use  Pin as Default Member  to make
any member the Default Member, it's possible to have a member named "Default
member" that is not actually the Default Member. Throughout this article, whenever26/12/2025, 14:23 Explainer: What Are Unmapped Dimensions and Default Members? – Vena Solutions

What is an Unmapped Dimension?
In the past, whenever you mapped a V ena template, you had to make sure to map at least one
member from every dimension manually. This is because mappings point at specific data
intersections in your V ena database, and you can only successfully describe an intersection if you
reference all of the dimensions in the data model.
Think of this as being like sending a letter : even if you included the recipient's name, street, city ,
state and zip code on the address label, the delivery fails if you leave out the house number . It's
the same way with intersections in your database, as V ena Desktop needs details
from  every dimension in your data model to "deliver" the data you want.

Filling unmapped dimensions on V ena Desktop
Vena Desktop's  Unmapped Dimension  feature relaxes this requirement. While it's still true that
every intersection must be described by using a member from every dimension, you no longer have
to map each of those members  manually.
Benefits:
Speeds up template creation, especially for  Ad Hoc reports .
Simplifies  data model updates —adding a new dimension  won’t  break old templates,
since  it’s auto-filled with a Default Member .
When you don't explicitly map a dimension, the Unmapped Dimension feature automatically
fills in a member for you to create a valid (complete) mapping. The member it uses for this
purpose is the  Default Member .'Default Member' is mentioned, it refers to the  concept, not the member with that
name.
Also, don't worry if you don't have any member named "Default member" in your data
model. This is common because, historically, many Modelers would often delete this
member right after creating a dimension. Likewise, it's fairly likely that  none  of your
members is currently set as the Default Member (i.e., no member has the
  icon).
Read on below to learn why.
 Mapping with Unmapped Dimension
With Unmapped Dimension, you can leave  any dimension unmapped while building a
template, in any section or block, and the template will still work. K eep in mind that you26/12/2025, 14:23 Explainer: What Are Unmapped Dimensions and Default Members? – Vena Solutions

What is the  Pin as Default  option used for?
Now that you know how Unmapped Dimension works, it's logical to conclude that this is where  Pin
as Default Member  comes in. Is it used to tell V ena Desktop which member to use as the Default
Member?
The answer is both yes and no, because it depends on when the dimension was created. For any
dimension that was created after the Default Member feature first entered beta (March 26, 2018),
the automatically created first member (the one named  Default member ) will also be set as the
Default Member, so there is no need to set it as such ( see note ).
However, for dimensions that existed before these features became available, none of the members
in the dimension are automatically set as the Default Member. For these dimensions where no
Default Member exists, Unmapped Dimension simply uses a fallback in its place: this "Default
Member by default" is the  All Member , a virtual member that represents a parent of all members in
the dimension (it's a "virtual" member because it's an abstraction, rather than a real member that is
listed in the Data Modeler).
This All Member  fallback allows Unmapped Dimension to work with all pre-existing dimensions, but
there is an important consideration to bear in mind when you leave a dimension unmapped that
has no set Default Member. Since the  All Member  will be used in place of the Default Member in
this case, the resulting template can't be used to save data. This is because the  All Member  is a
parent member, but intersections on an input template must be comprised solely of members that
are at the bottom-level of the member hierarchy.
Therefore, the  Pin as Default Member  option actually functions as an override:
For old dimensions without a set Default Member, it allows you to specify a bottom-level
member to be used as the Default Member in place of the  All Member . This enables input
templates to be created using Unmapped Dimensions.
For new dimensions, it allows you to set a Default Member other than the one that was
automatically set when you created the dimension. This is useful if there is another member that
you would rather use.
You can use  Pin as Default Member  to make  any other member in a dimension the Default Member,
whenever you like. One thing to keep in mind is that, if you make any parent member the Default
Member, you will not be able to create input templates with Unmapped Dimension, for the reason
outlined above.must still map at least one dimension to each row and column, as this defines where
the intersections are located on the template. If you don't do this, V ena Desktop won't
know where to place the data.

What happens if I change or delete the member that is
currently set as the Default Member?
At any time, you can select another member and make it the Default Member using  Pin as Default
Member . You can also delete the member that is currently designated as the Default Member, which
will, of course, also unset it as the Default Member as a consequence.
General rules:
If you delete the Default Member and do not set a new Default Member, then the All Member
will become the  de fact o Default Member.
If you change the member designated as the Default Member, this will take effect immediately.
All templates will automatically use the new Default Member anytime the relevant dimension
is left unmapped.
If the current Default Member has ever been used to "fill in" for an unmapped dimension on an
input template, and that template has been used to input and save data, then the Default Member
will be associated with intersection values. This means that changing the Default Member in this
case will affect any templates and reports that relied on the old Default Member.

Example 1:  a data model with four dimensions
If you map a template using this data model, every intersection would have to be defined by all
four of these dimensions. Now, consider a template on which you mapped dimensions 1, 2 and 3
with specific members, but left dimension 4 unmapped. The Default Member would be used to
complete the mapping. If you now use this template to input and save data, each value you save
will be defined by a set of four members, one of which is always the dimension 4 Default Member,
like this:
Dim 1 Dim 2 Dim 3 Dim 4 (unmapped) Value
Widget 1.0 January Sales Default Member 15,000For dimensions created after March 26, 2018 (when the Default Member feature
entered beta), the first member (usually named  "Default member")  is automatically set
as the Default Member. There's no need for any manual action.  (see note ).
For dimensions created before March 26, 2018, no Default Member is automatically set.
If you created a new dimension between March 26, 2018, and May 16, 2018, you should
check the dimension to see if any member that you are using for another purpose (i.e.,
as a "real" dimension member) may be unexpectedly set as the Default Member. If this
is the case, we recommend that you unset it (see  the note below  for more information ).26/12/2025, 14:23 Explainer: What Are Unmapped Dimensions and Default Members? – Vena Solutions

Widget XL January Sales Default Member 7,200

These values are now tied to these specific sets of members. As long as you don't change either the
mapping of the template or dimension 4's Default Member, these same values will appear every
time you open the template.
However, if you change the Default Member in dimension 4 to a different member and then open
up the same template again, the values you saved previously will no longer appear. Why? Since
dimension 4 now has a  new Default Member, all of the intersections on the template will
automatically be defined using that member, like this:

Dim 1 Dim 2 Dim 3 Dim 4 (unmapped) Value
Widget 1.0 January Sales New  Default Member
Widget XL January Sales New  Default Member

The only way to retrieve the previous values would be to add a mapping to the template for
dimension 4, setting it to the member that was previously the Default Member.
Changing the Default Member can be problematic, but more importantly, deleting a Default
Member associated with intersection values will also destroy the relevant intersections, resulting in
the loss of that data. As a result, you should always be careful if you're thinking about changing or
deleting a Default Member.

 Best Practices for using the Default Member
Given the potential risks of setting, changing or deleting the Default Member, here are
some recommendations for using this feature:
In general, you should only set a Default Member if not doing so would break
existing templates. The most common case for this would be adding a new
dimension in an existing V ena environment. Here, adding the dimension will
automatically set a Default Member as well. This allows all existing input templates
to keep working without needing to be remapped with the new dimension (and
means you don't have to remember to set a Default Member on the new
dimension).
If you rely on a Default Member to enable input templates when expanding a data
model, we recommend that you do NO T change it to another member at any point.26/12/2025, 14:23 Explainer: What Are Unmapped Dimensions and Default Members? – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002809851-Explainer-What-Are-Unmapped-Dimensions-and-Default-Members 6/7

You should only change or delete a Default Member if absolutely necessary, and if
you are confident that it is not associated with any intersection values. This will
typically be the case only if you have just created a new dimension, and the
automatically set Default Member is brand new (and therefore hasn’t been used on
a template yet).
For existing dimensions created prior to March 26, 2018, no Default Member will be
set. W e recommend not setting a Default Member on these dimensions and
therefore relying on the  All Member  when using the Unmapped Dimension feature
on a template. This will reduce the risk of associating intersection values with a
Default Member, at the expense of not being able to leave these dimensions
unmapped on input templates (only reports can be created if you leave a dimension
unmapped that defaults to the All Member).
Templates that rely on Unmapped Dimension are not compatible with
