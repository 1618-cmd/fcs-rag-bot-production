Explainer: Target Member Attribute
Calc Trigger

With  target member attr ibute calc tr igger s, attaching an attribute referenced in a calc
to a member is easier and more intuitive than ever! R ead on to learn more about this
feature and how it can help keep your data current and accurate.

What is a target member attribute calc trigger?
When writing calcs in vena.io, users can leverage Attribute functions to further scope out member
sets for calculations. Previously, when you added a new attribute to a member to include it in the
target scope of a calc, you had to manually deploy the calc to update values. Up until now, V ena
only triggered calcs automatically after data saves/changes.  With the  target member attr ibute
calc tr igger , you can now attach an attribute to a member to include it in the scope of an existing
calc, and V ena will automatically trigger the calc to run and run an ETL job to calculate the affected
scope.

Why should I use this feature?
Historically, when you attached an attribute referenced in a calc scope to a member (or members),
you had to deploy the calc manually to keep your intersections up to date. With the target member
attribute calc trigger, you don’t have to worry about manual deploys when updating your members
with new attributes. With the target member attribute calc trigger, you can attach an attribute
referenced in a cal to a member and V ena will automatically trigger the calc to deploy via an ETL
job. This feature ensures the maintenance of attributes referenced in calc scopes are always up to
date and data in your cube remain current and relevant.

When you attach an attribute that’s referenced in the scope of a calc to a dimension member (or
members), V ena triggers the calc to start an ETL job that runs the calc and updates the new target
scope values.

In the following example, the scope of this calc is based on the attribute ( FX).

1. Identify the calc with the corresponding attribute in the calc scope. In the example below we
have a simple calc statement, including an  .Attribute() calc function.
Scope {[Account.Balance Sheet].Leaves() .Attribute("FX") , [Year.2019]}
@this=[Year.2020] +1
End
2. Navigate to the  Modeler  tab and select the data model that corresponds to the data model
where the calc exists and where the relevant attribute can be found.
3. Select a dimension to manage the attributes associated with that dimension’s members.
4. Use the checkboxes to the left of the member names and select the members that you want to
update.Caution
In order for this feature to work, your calc must utilize this attribute function to
define a subset of members in scope.29/12/2025, 08:07 Explainer: Target Member Attribute Calc Trigger – Vena Solutions

5. Select the  Actions  menu. Select  Attach A ttributes from the drop-down list.
6. Use the drop-down list in the Attach Attributes pop-up to select your desired attribute that is
referenced in the calc script. In this instance, the attribute “ FX” is included in the active calc from
step 1.
When you attach an attribute referenced in a calc scope to one or more members using  bulk
attribute attach , you will see a message that will let you know that you are attaching an attribute
referenced in a calc.29/12/2025, 08:07 Explainer: Target Member Attribute Calc Trigger – Vena Solutions

If you want to continue with attaching the attribute(s), select  Save.
7. Saving your selection will trigger V ena to start an ETL job to deploy the calc. Y ou should see two
confirmation messages at the left corner of the screen:
One message will confirm that the attribute attachment was successful; the other will confirm
that an ETL job has begun. Y ou can further click the hyperlink “ETL page” to go to the History
tab and see the progress of the calculation.
8. Other ways to update attributes ( in addition t o bulk att ach attr ibutes):
1.  Single-member add/edit  - You can also create or edit individual members and attach
attributes at that time and this feature will also be activated in the New Modeler if the
attribute is included in a calc scope:
2. ETL attr ibute uplo ad - In both the New and Old Modeler, users that are updating member
Attributes through a .csv upload file will see an extra  Calculating  step in the ETL job. This
only occurs if the attachment of attributes brings any new members into the target calc
scope of an existing calc.

What if I want to detach an attribute referenced in a
calc?
You can detach attributes in similar ways (bulk, single-member edit, ETL). However, they will not
“un-deploy” the portion of the calc that was previously run when that same attribute was attached.
This feature does not “undo” when you detach an attribute (in other words,  we do not r emov e
data fr om int ersections when attr ibutes ar e detached ). If you want to remove an attribute from
a member and revert the calculations, you must perform a full Undeploy from the Scripts tab. If you
choose to simply detach an attribute from a member, any future deployments of the calc will no
longer have that member in scope.
If you want to detach an attribute corresponding to a calc from a member, you must:
1. Detach the attributes on the Members page .
2. Do a full undeploy on the Scripts page. Simply detaching an attribute referenced in a calc from a
member via the Members page will not update the corresponding calc script.
