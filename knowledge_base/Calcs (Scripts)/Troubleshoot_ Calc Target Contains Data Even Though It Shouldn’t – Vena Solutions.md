Troubleshoot: Calc Target Contains
Data Even Though It Shouldn’t
Issue summary
When viewing your template, you may notice that intersections that were calculated via a calc script
contain data even though they should not contain any data.

Suggested solution
1. Calc targets rely on their source intersections. Check and ensure the source intersection for these
calc targets does not have data. T o do this, do a Drill Saves then a Drill Calc.
2. If the source intersections have data, then you have to clear out those intersections which should
also then clear out the target intersections.

3. If the source intersections have been cleared out and the calc target is still not clearing out as
shown below, locate the appropriate calc script and manually deploy it.
