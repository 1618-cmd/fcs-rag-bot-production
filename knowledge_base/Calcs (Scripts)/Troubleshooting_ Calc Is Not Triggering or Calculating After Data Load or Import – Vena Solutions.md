# Troubleshooting  Calc Is Not Triggering or Calculating After Data Load or Import – Vena Solutions

Troubleshooting: Calc Is Not
Triggering or Calculating After Data
Load or Import
Issue summary
After uploading intersection files you may notice that the calc script is not working.

Suggested solution
1. If your script is a currency conversion calc, ensure the  rate is saved before the  local values are
saved. If this is not the case, you may need to clear the local value and reload it manually to
trigger the calc script.  Visit this article on Currency Conversions for more information.
2. If your script references an attribute, ensure the attributes exist and the appropriate members
are attached correctly. Y ou should ensure that at least one dimension member is attached to
any attribute referenced in your script.
3. Ensure your local or rate values do not have a comma (,) or double quotes (" "). This is because
the system treats values with commas or double quotes (e.g., "1,223" or 1,233) as text.
Arithmetic operations cannot be applied to texts/strings. Check your template or map out a
source intersection and then do a Drill Saves to confirm how the value is saved in the cube.
4. If your script is an allocation script, ensure the dimension used as the allocation flag is actually
changing values. The script will not calculate all the intersections if the allocation flag itself is not

changing in value.  Visit the article on Notation and S yntax for more information.
5. If your script was disabled at any point when you must have loaded source intersections, you
will have to re-enable and deploy the script manually.
6. If the part of your script that does the calculation is performing multiplication, it is important to
ensure that both or all sides of the formula exist and none have a zero value.
For example, @this = A x B
If A or B does not exist or either one has a zero value, the corresponding target intersection will
have no value since nothing x 3 = nothing.
7. If the target intersection of your script is more than 50,000 intersections and your script does
not have the #Use No "Autosparse", then your script will be automatically converted to a sparse
script (i.e., similar to a .sparse script). When a calc is in sparse mode, to improve performance,
some values may not be calculated.  Please visit  Reference: Sparse Calcs  for more details.
8. If versioning was involved and was used to create your source intersection, ensure that the
option to  Run Calcs  was selected when setting up and running the versioning job. If this is not
the case you may need to re-run the versioning job again and select  Run Calcs  or manually29/12/2025, 09:02 Troubleshooting: Calc Is Not Triggering or Calculating After Data Load or Import – Vena Solutions

deploy the script.
9. If your script uses a process variable, ensure the process variable name is unique and the same
name is not used with other processes. Also, ensure the appropriate dimension member is
attached to the process variable.
10. If a member was unmapped and was later moved into the correct position in the hierarchy after
the local values were loaded you may need to manually deploy the calc or clear the local value
and reload it manually to trigger the calc script.   Visit this article on Currency Conversions for
more information.
