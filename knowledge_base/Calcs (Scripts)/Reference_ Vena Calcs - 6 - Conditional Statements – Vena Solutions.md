Conditional Statements
A statement that starts with “ If” (If statements) s is the primary conditional statement.

An If statement:
Requires a boolean expression as its conditional test and may optionally be followed by one or
more  ElseIf  statements.
Is terminated by an  End statement.
Performs conditional tests within a formula. Using the IF statement, you can define a boolean
test, as well as formulas to be calculated if the test returns either a TRUE or F ALSE value.

An ELSEIF  statement:
Defines a conditional test and conditions that are performed if the preceding IF test generates a
value of F ALSE. For this reason, multiple ELSEIF commands are allowed following a single IF.

Example 1:
If ( [Measure.Sales] > 100 )
    // do something
ElseIf ( [Measure.Sales] > 10 )
    // do something else
Else
    // do some third thing
End

Example 2:
If (( [Measure.Sales] > 100 ) && ( [Measure.Sales] < 200 ))
    // do something29/12/2025, 08:58 Reference: Vena Calcs - 6 - Conditional Statements – Vena Solutions

ElseIf (( [Measure.Sales] > 201 ) && ( [Measure.Sales] < 300 ))
    // do something else
Else
    // do some third thing
End
The parenthesis around boolean expressions for  If and  ElseIf  statements are always required.
