Troubleshooting Vena
CopilotThe Chat page is available to AI Model Managers and all Contributor users with a Vena Copilot
license. The Chat page opens to six pre-built queries. Users can select one of these queries or
type in their own. If users see a blank page when they navigate to the Chat page, they do not
have access to any AI models.
How does Pre-Built Queries and Automatic Model Selection work?
The six pre-built queries show you what Vena Copilot can do. These queries are pulled from
each AI model’s Prompt Library.
Since you may have multiple AI models, Vena Copilot uses logic to route each query to the most
relevant one. It matches the prompt’s Member Selection to the model’s Scope to find the best fit.
If multiple AI models match, you’ll be asked to choose one before the response is shown.05/01/2026, 16:24 Explainer: Vena Copilot Tab – Vena Solutions

Product Updates
The same logic applies to typed queries – referenced members are checked against model
Scopes to find the right match.
How do I use Panel View?
Vena Copilot is often used alongside features like Vena Insights. To support this, we’ve added the
Open Chat in Panel View option in the top right corner of the Chat page.05/01/2026, 16:24 Explainer: Vena Copilot Tab – Vena Solutions

bottom right corner.

What is the Builder page?
Builder is the new location of the AI Builder tab. This page is available to all users with Vena
Copilot and Modeler user permissions. All of the AI models that the user has Model
Management access to are listed on this page. Learn how to manage AI models and
conversations from the Builder page.
The Builder page contains two tables:
Chats: A list of past conversations users have had with this AI model.
Prompt Library: Contains prompts used to train Vena Copilot.
If a Modeler user does not have Manage Model access to any AI models, they will see a screen
prompting them to create an AI model.
Note
Your chat history carries over between Panel View and full-page if you’ve exchanged
at least one message with Vena Copilot.05/01/2026, 16:24 Explainer: Vena Copilot Tab – Vena Solutions

Troubleshooting - Blank Chat Page
If Contributor users see a blank page instead of prompts on the Chats page, it means no AI
models are published, or the model Scopes are too narrow to include any Prompt Library
content. In that case, users will see the following screen:05/01/2026, 16:24 Explainer: Vena Copilot Tab – Vena Solutions

To fix this, follow these steps to create an AI model and these steps to make changes to the AI
model Scope.
