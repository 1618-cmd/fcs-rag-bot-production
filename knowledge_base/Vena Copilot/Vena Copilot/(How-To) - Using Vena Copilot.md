Product Updates
Why use this feature?
Vena Copilot allows you to ask questions about your data and get instant responses and Ad Hoc
reports created directly from that data. Increase your operational agility by accessing relevant
data even faster. Take advantage of the increased breadth and quality of analysis without
manually writing queries or creating reports.
Vena Copilot is currently powered by two agents:
Analytics Agent: Responds to prompts related to analytics and gaining insights into your
data. Prompts like “What is my revenue per headcount in 2024?” will trigger the Analytics
Agent.
Reporting Agent: Responds to prompts asking for a report to be generated. Prompts like
“Create a report showing Q3 2024 marketing expenses.” will trigger the Reporting Agent.
Before you begin
You will need a Vena Copilot license to follow the steps in this guide.

How to
Launching Vena Copilot
Navigate to the Vena Copilot tab and open the Chat page.
Warning
Vena Copilot keeps a log of all chat inputs, which are accessible by your AI Model
Managers to help them further refine the AI models. Your AI Model Managers can
see the date and contents of your message, your feedback (thumbs up/down) and all
Vena Copilot responses.05/01/2026, 16:25 How-To: Using Vena Copilot – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/25823124947853-How-To-Using-Vena-Copilot 4/14

When Vena Copilot opens, you can choose a curated prompt or type your own. If there’s more
than one AI model, select which model to interact with. These AI models have been set up by
your AI Model Managers. In the following example, there are three AI models to choose from. If
you have multiple AI models to choose from, their names are likely an indicator of the types of
questions/topics it can answer. For example, a Revenue model can answer questions related to05/01/2026, 16:25 How-To: Using Vena Copilot – Vena Solutions

revenue.
To switch from the current AI model to a different one at any time or ask another question,
select Start Again. You will be taken back to the list of curated prompts to choose from.
Freely navigate between your Vena tabs while using Vena Copilot by switching from the full-page
view to the panel view by selecting Open in Panel View. If you navigate from one tab to another
(e.g., Manager to Modeler), the Vena Copilot chat stays open, and the chat history carries over.
Select the minimize icon to temporarily close the Vena Copilot chat – the icon remains at the
bottom right corner of the screen as you navigate Vena.05/01/2026, 16:25 How-To: Using Vena Copilot – Vena Solutions

Generating and Downloading Reports and Visuals
Create reports faster by asking Vena Copilot to generate one directly in the chat. Instead of
receiving insights as text, you can generate a detailed Vena Ad Hoc report based on your
financial data for further analysis and distribution. When you open the report in Vena Ad Hoc, a
chart is automatically included to help you quickly visualize your data.
To generate and download a report:
1. Launch Vena Copilot.
2. Ask Vena Copilot to generate a report.
For example, you can ask “Create an actual vs budget report for all 12 months of 2024.” For
optimal results, start your prompt with “Create, Generate or Build a report”.
3. If there's multiple AI models that relate to your query, select the AI Model you’d like to use.05/01/2026, 16:25 How-To: Using Vena Copilot – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/25823124947853-How-To-Using-Vena-Copilot 7/14

4. Select Downlo ad Repor t.
5. Open the report from your Download folder.
6. The report opens in a Vena Ad Hoc file.
7. Make any necessary changes to the report in Vena Ad Hoc. Upon refresh any mapping
updates will apply to the report data and visuals. Charts can be modified using Excel
functionality.

Rating Reporting Agent Reports
When you receive a report from Vena Copilot, we highly recommend that you provide feedback
about whether it matches your expectations. This flags the response for your AI Model Manager
so that they can train Vena Copilot to provide more accurate reports based on your queries. 05/01/2026, 16:25 How-To: Using Vena Copilot – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/25823124947853-How-To-Using-Vena-Copilot 8/14

1. Follow steps 1-5 in Generating and Downloading Reports to open the report in Vena Ad Hoc.
2. If the report matches your expectations for the V ena Copilot query, select Yes. If the report doesn’t
match your expectations, select Needs Adjustment  and make the required changes to the report
directly in Vena Ad Hoc.

Rating Analytics Agent Responses
When you receive an analytics response from Vena Copilot, we recommend that you provide
feedback about the response to reflect accuracy and help improve Vena Copilot. Rate the
message by selecting thumbs up (correct) or thumbs down (incorrect). This flags the response
for your AI Model Manager so that they can identify the response and better train the model.
Note
If you’re an AI Model Manager, follow the steps to create a Prompt based on the
query.05/01/2026, 16:25 How-To: Using Vena Copilot – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/25823124947853-How-To-Using-Vena-Copilot 9/14


Downloading/Copying Analytics Agent Responses
To download a csv file of the data used to inform the response to your prompt, select the
Download data icon. This is a useful tool if you are trying to better understand the underlying
data behind the response.
The Copy button copies the response you are interacting with into your clipboard so you can
seamlessly share out insights.

Asking Questions
Keep the following principles in mind when asking questions:
Be as specific as possible. Think of Vena Copilot as your own personal Financial Analyst. To
ensure they carry out the analysis you are looking for, be as direct as possible. The most
common issues come from questions that are too ambiguous or a lack of data to inform your
question in the Cube.
Be specific about the type of response you’re looking for. If you want a report generated,
start your question with “Create a report...” For insights into your data, start your question
with something like “What is my revenue for ...”
Suggest a word limit. Adding “Limit response to 100 words” may make the Vena Copilot
output easier to interpret.05/01/2026, 16:25 How-To: Using Vena Copilot – Vena Solutions
https://support.venasolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/25823124947853-How-To-Using-Vena-Copilot 10/14

Refer to specific members in your data model. This makes it easier for the model to
retrieve the correct insight. For example, if your sales data is stored in a Revenue member
when asking about sales, it’s best practice to refer to Revenue instead of Sales.
Specify your department/entity/business unit. Vena Copilot is not aware of user-specific
data, so it would not be able to answer a question like “What is the expense in my
department in 2024?”. Instead, specify the department you are referring to.
Check with your Finance team to see if the Date functionality has been configured.
Date functionality allows you to ask questions about “this month” and “this year”. If this has
not been configured, you will need to specify which time period you are inquiring about.
Provide instructions when there’s complex, multi-step calculation involved. Instructing
the model what to do step-by-step will aid it greatly.
All of your queries are visible to your AI Model Manager. Be mindful of your input.
Notes & limitations
Vena Copilot's data is limited to the defined scope of your data model and cannot access web
resources.
Vena Copilot does not perform forward-looking tasks such as generating forecasts.
Vena Copilot cannot retrieve data from dimension members that contain special characters
(e.g., ö, ç,ñ). To ensure compatibility and accuracy, avoid using special characters in member
names when asking Copilot questions. As a best practice, design data models without special
characters in member names whenever possible.
