platform you know and trust. Think of Vena Copilot as your FP&A analyst, designed to perform
FP&A tasks such as retrieving data from your data models and performing analysis. This means
Vena Copilot can answer your users’ questions and return a response grounded in the data
stored in your models.

analysis. It turns words into your most powerful productivity tool. Vena Copilot combines the
power of large language models with your Vena data to automate mundane tasks, provide
relevant insights and make data analysis accessible for anyone in your organization.
Vena Copilot allows users to gain insights from their CubeFLEX data via a chatbot; there’s no
need to build queries or reports. Your users can ask questions like, “What is my year-over-year
revenue growth in May 2023 broken down by Business Unit?” or “Which Entity has the largest
Revenue for 2023?” and get instant responses.
