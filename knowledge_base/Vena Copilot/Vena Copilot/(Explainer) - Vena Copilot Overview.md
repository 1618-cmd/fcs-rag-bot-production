How long will it take to set up an AI model?
The initial setup is expected to take 5-10 minutes. The experience is designed to familiarize you
with Vena Copilot concepts and management while customizing AI models for your users.
Setting up Vena Copilot requires the following steps:
1. An Admin user grants the Vena Copilot user roles.
2. An AI Model Manager creates a Vena Copilot AI model.
3. An AI Model Manager sets Assumed Members.
4. An AI Model Manager publishes the Vena Copilot AI model.
5. Users can begin chatting with Vena Copilot.
Once Vena Copilot is launched, users can provide feedback on the model's responses. AI Model
Managers can view all user prompts/feedback, Vena Copilot responses and improve the AI
model by creating additional Prompts.
Where will my data be used?
Data privacy and security is our primary concern. We designed our solution to provide you with
the confidence that your data remains your data. Specifically, we:
Worked with Microsoft to ensure the Azure Open AI (AOAI) models we are leveraging will not:
Leave your region, so we can fulfill GDPR and any other data residency requirements.
Leave your designated safe zone on the Azure tenant.
Be used to train any master models or other client models.
Set up private web sockets between our Amazon and Azure environments, making sure the
data in transit is secure.
Designed architecture that does not share member names, intersection data or any other
metadata between AI models. This holds true even if the two models exist on the same05/01/2026, 16:25 Explainer: Vena Copilot Overview – Vena Solutions

customer tenant, based off the same cube.
Ensured SOC compliance for our product as a whole as well as the underlying services Azure
Open AI (AOAI).
How will AI Model Managers view feedback about model
performance?
To help AI Model Managers determine which questions need attention, users can provide
feedback to the model through thumbs up/down buttons in the chatbot. AI Model Managers see
a log of all user interactions with the chatbot, including feedback to responses. In this
experience, AI Model Managers will be able to:
Set Assumed Members to control dimension-specific constructs.
Create Prompts by inputting member references and custom instructions at the question
level.
