Suggested solution
If a Rule already exists for the prompt, refine the rule. Avoid the use of
IDescendants/BottomLevel but if you must use IDescendants/BottomLevel, only use it on one
dimension. This is because the narrower the rule, the less likely it is to pull too much data.
If a Rule does not exist for the prompt, please create one. Visit How-To: Setting Rules in Vena
Copilot for more details.
If the issue persists, please refine your prompt to pull less data. You can do this by
referencing more members or dimensions in your prompt.
