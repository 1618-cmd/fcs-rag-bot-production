Suggested solution
To resolve this issue, please resubmit your prompt with specific details for at least 2-3
dimensions. Ensure that you reference more members or dimensions in your prompt to provide
the necessary context for accurate mapping.
Cause
This error occurs when the column and row mappings provided in the user prompt are
insufficient, meaning there is not enough information or dimensions specified to map the
necessary dimensions in both rows and columns. For instance, if a user submits a prompt like
"create report" without mentioning any specific dimensions or context, the system cannot
generate the required mappings.06/01/2026, 10:08 Troubleshooting: Vena Copilot Error Code 1011 – More Information Required – Vena Solutions
