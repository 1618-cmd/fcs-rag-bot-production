Suggested solution
All data models used to create AI Models must have Dimension Types and Standard Members
assigned.
1. To tag your data model, please visit the How-To article on Assigning Dimension Types
and Standard Members.
2. Visit the How-To article on assigning Dimension Types and Standard Members.
3. Visit the Before you Begin section of the How-To article on Creating an AI Model for the
necessary Dimension Types and Standard Members you need to tag in your data model. This
includes the minimum Dimension Types and Standard Members needed to use Vena Copilot.
However, the more you tag, the better the experience will be. We recommend that you tag as
many Dimension Types and Standard Members as possible.
4. Once you tag your data model, return to the AI Builder to create an AI model.
Cause
This may happen if the dimension model selected does not have the appropriate Dimension
Types and Standard Members.
