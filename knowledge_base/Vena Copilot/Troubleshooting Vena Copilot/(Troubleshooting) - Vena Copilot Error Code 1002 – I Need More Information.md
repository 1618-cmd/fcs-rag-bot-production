Suggested solution
This may happen if your prompt is ambiguous.
For example, if we asked the AI model "What are my sales?". We would get this error message
since we've submitted an ambiguous prompt.
To fix this issue, we updated the prompt to include more members from the hierarchy (e.g.,
year). The new prompt is, "What are my sales for year 2022". Now that our prompt is more
specific, we successfuly get a response from the AI model.
