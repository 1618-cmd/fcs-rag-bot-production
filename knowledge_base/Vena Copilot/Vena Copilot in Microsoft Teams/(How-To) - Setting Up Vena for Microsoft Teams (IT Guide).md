Prerequisites for Installing Vena for Microsoft
Teams
Vena recommends that IT teams install Vena for Microsoft Teams for their users, instead of
allowing them to do it themselves. This ensures seamless access to new features as they’re
released and less work for IT teams in the future. To set up Vena for Microsoft Teams for your
users, the following prerequisites are required:
Enabling Org-wide app settings to allow third-party apps to be installed.
Granting app permissions to those who will be using Vena for Microsoft Teams.
Enable Org-Wide App Settings
Org-wide app settings control users installing third-party apps in Microsoft Teams. These
settings apply to all users and override individual app permission policies. Allowing third-party
apps in Microsoft Teams is a prerequisite to use Vena.
To configure Org-wide app settings:
1. In Teams, select Teams Apps and then Manage apps.
2. Select Org-wide app settings. Under Third-party apps, verify the following:
Allow third-party apps is turned on.

disabled based on your organization’s policy.05/01/2026, 16:32 How-To: Setting Up Vena for Microsoft Teams (IT Guide) – Vena Solutions

requests, you can dismiss the requests.
